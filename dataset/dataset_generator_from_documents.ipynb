Current cosmology suggests that \\nthe creation of our universe is through a âbig bang.â \\nHowever, the natural law that has led to the big bang\\n waits to be explored further. \\n Joh\\nn Wheeler proposed [Refs 1, 2, 3] the idea \\nâIt\\n from Bit.â He suggested that\\n information sits at the \\ncore of physics and every\\n \"it,\" whether a particle or field, \\nderi\\nves its existence from observations. To show how \\nevery\\nthing comes to existence through observation, \\n \\n   The\\n Grand Unification Theory is an attempt to \\nuse one mathematical formula to explain everything, \\nincluding all elementary particles, fundamental forces, dark matter, dark energy, and the macro structure of the \\nuniverse, and to unify quantum physics with Einsteinâs \\ngeneral relativity theory about gravity. So far, string theory is the only mathematically consistent theory that can unify everything [Refs 4, 5]. However,\\n current string \\ntheory is still limited in its\\n ability to make predictions. \\nSomething is still missing. \\n In this paper, we propose Information \\nMechanics , in which\\n information determines and creates \\neverything we observe. We present\\n the\\n basic\\n principles\\n and formula about\\n how information underlies\\n all \\nobserved phenomena, including giving the emergence \\nto elementary particles, fundamental forces, dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and the universe. We proffer two basic laws governing Information Mechanics. The First Law of Information Mechanics comes from \\nquantum physics, indicating the information contained in our measurement determines the observed phenomena.\\n The Second Law of Information Mechanics comes from the ancient Chinese wisdom about yin yang. It proposes \\nthat two basic elements, yin and yang, make up \\neverything, including information, and that the interaction of these two elements creates all the observed physical phenomena. We will show that the \\ninteraction of two pairs of yin yang elements: space -time \\nand exclusion-exclusion, create all ele mentary particles, \\nforces, dark matter, dark energy, and the universe we observe.  \\nWe\\n show that the laws of Information \\nMechanics\\n give rise to an information action. Information \\naction represents the maximum possibilities, i.e., information, in a system. I nformation action appears to \\nbe similar to string action. From the information action, one can define information function. Information function calculates the possible states\\n in a system.\\n Information \\nfunction\\n seems to be an extension of wave function in \\nquantum mechanics. With information action and information function, we demonstrate that elementary \\nparticles and their wave -particle duality emerge from the \\nPoincarÃ©\\n symmetry, fundamental forces come about \\ndue to the diffeomorphism symmetry, and classical\\n equations of motion come from Weyl symmetry. \\nObservation of dark matter and dark energy at the large T\\n        \\n               \\n                          \\n                     1 Global Journal ofScience Frontier Research        Volume XX  Issue        ersion I VXIV Year2020\\n23\\n   (A)\\nÂ©2 0 20 Global JournalsAutho\\nrÎ±:Tao Academy, 30 Wertheim Court, Unit 27D, Richmond Hill, \\nOntario L4B 1B9, Canada. \\nAuthorÏ:Hawaii Theoretical Physics Research Center, 16 -266 E. \\nKipimana St, Keaau, HI 96749, USA . e-mail: rulin@htprc.orgJohn Wheeler acknowle\\ndged [Ref 3] that time played an \\nesse nt\\nial rol e, but this is not understood well enough. \\nscale of universe can be explained in Information \\nMechanics.

The interaction of these \\ntwo elements creates every thing. \\n The\\n Second Law of Information Mechanics\\n originates from ancient Chinese wisdom about yin yang [Ref 6, 7]. We keep\\n the Chinese words here and call \\nthese two basic elements that make up everything: yin \\nand yang. \\n These two basic elements, yin and yang, make \\nup the\\n âBitâ of information. The\\n Second Law of \\nInformation Mechanics\\n suggests the interaction of yin \\nand yang, the essential elements of information, creates \\neverything.\\n \\nIII.\\n \\nSpace and Time as the Fundamen tal \\nYin-Yang\\n Pair\\n \\nWhat ar\\ne the basic yin yang elements that \\ncreate the observed elementary particles, forces, dark matter, dark energy, and the universe? We suggest that space and time are one of the \\nfundamental pairs of yin -yang elements that create \\neverything we observe.  We propose another meaning of space -time, \\nwhich we call information space and time. Information space and time are related to two basic measurements we conduct. Information time relates to the measurement of movement and change. Information space relates to the measu rement of stillness and \\nsolidity. For instance, the flow of sand in an hourglass \\nand the movements of the sun and the moon have all been used as measurements of time. The duration of a day is based on the measurement of the rotation of the \\nearth. The measurements of space, such as the length, \\nheight, and width of an object, are the measurement of its fixedness and stillness.  \\nInformation space and time are a yin -yang pair. \\nThey are opposite and relative. Change and stillness are opposites and relative. Space  and time are  co-created  \\nbecause whenever one measures change,  one refers to \\nsomething unchanged. Whenever one measures something as unchanged, one compares it with something one considers changing. Therefore, \\ninformation space and time are inseparable and  co-\\ndependent. \\nAccording to quantum physics, it takes energy \\nand momentum to measure time and space. How \\naccurately time and space can be measured depends on the  amount of energy and momentum used in the \\nmeasurement. More specifically, to measure the time of \\nduration âÏ, it takes an energy of âð¸ð¸ ~ Ä§/âðð. To measure \\na space of size âÏ, it takes the momentum  âðð ~ Ä§/âðð.   \\nIf one takes gravity into consideration, \\naccording to general relativity, energy curves space -\\ntime. When one measures time interval âÏ, the energy \\nâE used  for a time measurement will curve space -time. \\nIt will create a black hole with the horizon on the order of GâE/c\\n4. When âÏ is smaller  th\\nan G âE/c4, no informati o\\nn \\ncan escape. Therefore, the measurable causal region is:  \\nâÏ â¥ GâE/c4. \\nThere fore,\\n there exists the uncertainty relation \\nbetween the measurable space âÏ and measurable \\ntime âÏ, \\n                                    âÏ âÏ â¥ lp tp.  \\nHere lp \\nis the Pla n\\nck length and tp is \\nthe Plan c\\nk \\ntime. This uncertainty relation suggests that information \\nspace and time affect each other. They are not independent. They are a yin -yang pair.  \\nNext, we propose that inclusion and exclusion \\nare the other \\nbasic yin -yang pair in measurement. T his is \\nbecause, when one makes a measurement, one needs to give the information about what is included and what is excluded.  \\nWe propound, all measurements are based on \\nthese two basic yin -yang pairs: information space -time \\nmeasurement and inclusive -exclus ive measurement. To \\nsee this, one can examine all \\npossible measurements, \\nsuch as measurement of velocity, acceleration, energy, momentum, temperature, spin, electricity, magnetic field, mass, charge, and force. One can see that these measurements are vario us combinations of space and \\nÂ©2 0 20 Global Journals1 Global Journal ofScience Frontier Research        Volume XX  Issue        ersion I VXIV Year2020\\n24\\n   (A)Informat i\\non Mechanics : The Dynamics of âIt from Bitâ\\n(1)', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\3-Information-Mechanics-The-Dynamics.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='time meas u\\nrement and inclusive and exclusive \\nmeasurement.  \\nIV. Derivation  of\\n Informati on\\n Action  \\nIf all m e\\nasurement is made of two basic \\nmeasurements: space -time measurement and inclusion -\\nexclusion measurement, according to the firs t and \\nsecond laws of Information Mechanics, the interaction of \\nthe space and time yin -yang pair and the interaction of \\nthe inclusion and exclusion yin -yang pair should create \\nall observed phenomena.  \\nThe simplest action created by the interaction of \\nthe information space  time is:  \\n                                           A1=Î±â«âÏâÏ . \\n(6) \\nHer\\ne the symbol Ï  represents information \\nspace and the symbol Ï represents information time. \\nThe integral symbol â« represents the summation over \\ninformation space and time, and ð¼ð¼ is a constant.

To do this, we realize that corresponding to \\nthe inclusion and exclusion yin -yang pair, in nature there \\nexist two types of particles, fermions and bosons. \\nFermions  have half (1/2) spin. They repel each other. \\nThey cannot be in the same state. Bosons have integer \\nspin. They tend to clump. The normal time and space \\ncoordinates Ï and Ï are of bosonic nature. If we assume \\neach information space or time coordinate has both the \\nfermion (yang, repulsive) and boson (yin, clumping) \\nparts, each information time and space coordinate become two elements:  \\n                                          Ï ->(Ï, Î¸\\nÏ)  (3) \\n                              \\n            Ï ->(Ï, Î¸Ï). (4) \\nHere we  u\\nse Î¸Ïand Î¸Ï to repres e\\nnt the fermion \\npart of information space and time coordinates  Ï and Ï. \\nThe Î¸Ïand Î¸Ïcan onl y\\n take on the value of 0 or 1 \\nbecause they are repulsive and refuse to stay at the same place. The four elements of the two yin -yang pairs  \\nare represented by Ï , Ï, Î¸\\nÏ,and Î¸ Ï.  \\nThe sim p\\nlest action created by thes e two yin -\\nyang pairs is:  \\n                                  A2=Î±ââ«âÏâÏâ  Î¸ÏâÎ¸Ï. \\n(7) \\nWe will c a\\nll the action A1 and A2the info rm\\nation action.  \\nOne can see that the action A1 is basicall y\\n the \\naction of  bosonic string and the action A2 is the acti o\\nn of \\nthe super  string [Ref 4, 5]. It is interesting to see that \\nfrom the basic laws of Information Mechanics  we can \\nderive string action [Ref 4, 5].  There is  a fundamental difference in the \\nmeaning and function between information action and \\nstring action. For instance, suppose the integration of Ï  \\nand Ï is over (0, T) and (0, L). We can see that T and L \\ncorrespond to the time and space scale involved in our \\nmeasurement in Information Mechanics. They are \\ndifferent in different measurements. If our measurement and observation is the whole universe, T and L should be the age and horizon length of the universe. This is different from string theory, in which L is se t to be the \\nstring length and T is set to be infinite.  \\nThe information actions A\\n1 and A2 in equa t\\nions \\n(2) and (5) give the amount of the information in a system with the observation scale (0, T) and (0, L). Information action expresses the possible states that \\ncan be observed in a system.  Seth Lloyd  derived a \\nsimilar result in his paper [Ref 8], viz. that the maximum \\nobservable information in a system is represented by (2).  \\nV. \\nTwo Types of Space-Time \\nT o de r\\nive the observable phenomena in \\nInformation Mechanics, it is necessary to realize that \\nthere exist two types of space time. One is the \\ninformation space time associated with the fundamental \\nyin-yang pair ( Ï, Ï). It is related to the basic elements of \\ninformation. We call it information space and tim e. The \\nother is the physical measurement of space distance and time duration or physical location of space time ðð\\nðð.  \\nLetâs cal lðððð physic al\\n space and time.  \\nThe physical space and time ððððis a projec t\\nion \\nfrom the information space and time (Ï, Ï), \\nðððð: (Ï, Ï) ->ðððð (Ï, Ï). \\nSuppose\\n in this projection, the total information \\nis unchanged. The action A1 becomes: \\n         \\n                       ð´ð´1â²= ð¼ð¼â«ðððð ðððð (âdetâðððð) 1/2.  \\nHere, âðððð  = ðððððððððððððððð. \\nIn the fo llo\\nwing, for the sake of the simplicity of \\nillustration, we will work with the âbosonic string,â  \\nA1= Î±â«ðððððð\\n0â«ððððð¿ð¿\\n0. \\nOne can fol l\\now and extend the same discussion \\nto the general case of âsuperstring,â  \\nA2=Î±â²â«ðððððð\\n0â«ððððð¿ð¿\\n0dÎ¸ÏdÎ¸Ï. \\nVI. Definition of Information Function \\nNow letâs define the\\n information function Î¨: \\n                                               \\n  Î¨=exp(i A).   \\nHere A i s\\n the information action. We can see \\nthat the information function Î¨  is related to the amount \\nof information I in a system through the for mula:         \\n               \\n                          \\n                     1 Global Journal ofScience Frontier Research        Volume XX  Issue        ersion I VXIV Year2020\\n25\\n   (A)\\nÂ©2 0 20 Global JournalsInformat i\\non Mechanics : The Dynamics of âIt from Bitâ\\n(2)\\n(5)', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\3-Information-Mechanics-The-Dynamics.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='                                      I = A= -\\n ilnÎ¨.

The action in Information \\nMechanics integrates \\nover both time and space while the action in quantum \\nphysics integrates over time. \\nInformation Mechanics is also different from \\nquantum field theory. The action of Information Mechanics integr ates over two -dimensional information \\nspace and time, while in quantum field theory the action integrates over four -dimensional physical space time. \\nThe main task of quantum field theory is to calculate the correlation function and scattering cross -section s. In \\nInformation Mechanics, the correlation function and, thus, scattering cross- section can be obtained through \\nthe information function \\nin the equation (9). Note that the \\nwavelength and frequency in quantum field theory are now replaced with the measure ment scales T and L in \\nInformation Mechanics. We will discuss the correspondence between the calculations of Information Mechanics with those of quantum field theory in more detail in future work. \\nVII. \\nEmergence \\nof Elementa r\\ny Particles  \\na\\nnd Fundament a\\nl \\nForces \\nAs \\ndisco v\\nered in particle physics, the basic \\nconstituents of everything are elementary particles and \\nfundamental forces. It is found that elementary particles \\nhave wave -particle duality, meaning that they behave \\nlike a wave but each elementary particle has its own \\nspecific mass and spin, no matter where and when one makes the measurement. The wave -particle duality of \\nelementary particles and fundamental forces was proposed by Einstein and Niels Bohr and indicated by experiments [Ref10, 11]. However, it is nev er derived \\nfrom the first principle in theoretical physics.  \\n In the following, we show  how the wave -particle \\nduality of elementary particles and fundamental force  se \\nmerge in Information Mechanics.  \\nTo do this, first notice, as shown in string theory \\n[Ref 4,5],it is possible to introduce a metric tensor ð¾ð¾\\nðððð \\nand rewrite  th\\ne actionð´ð´1â²in (6) in  t\\nhe form:  \\nð´ð´1â²â² \\n[X, \\nð¾ð¾] \\n= ð¼ð¼â«ðððð \\nðððð \\n(âdetð¾ð¾ðððð) 1/2ð¾ð¾ðððððððððððððððððððð.  \\nIn Informatio n M\\nechanics, the possibility to \\nintroduce tensor ð¾ð¾ðððð \\nis due t o\\n the relativity between the \\nyin yang, the information time and space ( ðð,ðð).  \\nThe action ð´ð´1â²â²  \\nis invarian\\nt under the following \\nthree transformations: \\n1. \\nD-dimensional PoincarÃ© \\ntransformation \\n                              ððâ²ðð(ðð,ðð)= \\nÎðððððððð(ðð,ðð)+ \\nðððð \\n \\n       \\n                              ð¾ð¾â²ðððð(ðð,ðð)= \\nð¾ð¾ðððð(ðð,ðð)  \\n2. \\nDiffeo m\\norphism transformation \\n                                    ððâ²ðð(ðð,ðð)=   ðððð(ðð,ðð) \\n \\n       \\n                ððððâ²ðð\\nððððâ²ððððððâ²ðð\\nððððâ²ððð¾ð¾â²ðððð(ððâ²,ððâ²)= ð¾ð¾ðððð(ðð,ðð)  \\n3.

Weyl Invarian ce, Hologra phy,\\n and \\nClassica l\\n Equation s\\n of Motion  \\nThe W e\\nyl invariance (13) is automatically \\npreserved at the first order in information action. However, higher- order corrections could possibly violate  \\nit. For instance, in [Refs 4, 5], it is shown that  there are \\nthe following second -order corrections to the information \\naction:  \\n                      Î²\\nGÎ¼Î½=Î± RÎ¼Î½+ Î±/4 HÎ¼Î»ÏHÎ½Î»Ï+ O(Î±2)  (15)  \\n                  \\n           Î²BÎ¼Î½= - Î±/4 âÏHÎ¼Î»Ï+ O(Î±2). (16)  \\nThe prese\\nrvation of Weyl Invariance at the \\nhigher orders requires that:  \\nÎ²GÎ¼Î½= Î²BÎ¼Î½= 0. \\nNotice  th\\nat Î²GÎ¼Î½= 0 lead s\\n to the generalized \\nEinsteinâs equation with the source terms from the anti -symmetric tensor. The equation  Î²BÎ¼Î½=0 is the an\\nti \\nsymmetric generalization of Maxwellâs equations.  \\nWe can see that requiring Weyl invariance, one \\nis able to obtain classical equations of motion including Einsteinâs general relativity  and gauge interactions. In \\nthis way, Information Mechanics includes cla ssical \\nphysics.  \\nIn Information Mechanics, all the physical \\nphenomena are projected from a two -dimensional \\ninformation space  time. The two -dimensional \\ninformation space  time has Weyl invariance. This  \\nmeans that  the two -dimensional information space  time \\nis a hologram from which all observed phenomena, \\nincluding physical space  time, elementary particles, \\ngravity, and gauge interactions  emerge . Classical \\nequations of motion come from the holographic nature, the Weyl invariance of information space  time.  \\nXI. \\nEmergence of Dark Energy and  Dark \\nMatter \\nThe o\\nbserved accelerated expansion and large \\nstructure of our universe [Refs12, 13, 14, 15, 16]indicates an unknown source of energy, dark energy, and an unknown source of matter, dark matter. There are many proposals about the potential candidates for \\ndark matter and dark energy.  \\nIn the following, we will show that Information \\nMechanics may explain the observation of dark energy \\nand dark matter. Dark matter and dark energy can emerge from information function.  \\nDark energy and dark matter are phenomena \\nobserved in the large structure of the universe. To see \\nwhat matter and energy emerges in the large structure of universe, we need to study the information function: \\nÎ¨=exp(ið´ð´1â²â² \\n)  = â«ðððð \\nexp(i ð´ð´1â²â² \\n). \\nHere  \\nð´ð´1â²â² \\n=Î±â«ðððððð\\n0â«ððððð¿ð¿\\n0(âdetð¾ð¾ðððð)1\\n2(ð¾ð¾ðððððºðºðððð+ \\nðððððððµðµðððð)ðððððððððððððððð, \\nwhere T is  t\\nhe age of the universe and L is the length of \\nthe horizon of the universe.  \\nOne may notice that in the information function \\nÎ¨, there exist vibrations in the energy state (n, m) with \\nthe frequency Î½n= n/T an\\nd wavelength Î»m \\n= L/m. Th\\ne \\nfrequency and wavelength of some of these vibrations \\nhave a frequency and wavelength on the order of 1/T and L. These vibrations are almost impossible to detect at this moment. This is because, to observe them, \\nit \\ntakes a \\ndetector as large as the universe or it takes time \\nas long as the age of the universe.

Calculati o\\nn of Cosmologi c\\nal \\nConstant \\nThe c o\\nsmological constant is the simplest \\npossible form of dark energy. The current standard \\nmodel of cosmology, the Lambda -CDM model, \\nassumes a non- zero cos mological constant as the \\nsource of dark energy. It is found that, in terms of the Planck unit, and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant is calculated to be on the order of 10\\nâ122 [Ref 15, 1\\n6]. The large discrepancy between \\nthe natural energy scale, Planck scale, and the observed value of 10\\nâ122 in terms  o\\nf Planck scale is the so called \\ncosmology constant problem.  \\nIn the following, we will estimate the vacuum \\nenergy of the information function. Surprisingly, we are \\nable to obtain a v alue for the cosmological constant \\nconsistent with the observation.  \\nTo calculate the vacuum energy of the universe, \\nwe use the fact that the energy at state (n, m) with the \\nfrequency Î½n= n/T an\\nd wavelength Î»m = L/m is : \\nEn,m = (n + Â½) Ä§ /T. \\nT\\nhe lowest energy of the vacuum fluctuation is \\nE0n,m = Ä§/2T.  \\nIn Inform\\nation Mechanics, with the space and \\ntime measurement scale at T and L, the total number of \\npossible states N is: \\nN = TL/(lptp). \\nIf we assu m\\ne each of the possible states can \\ncontribute to vacuum fluctuation energy of E0n,m \\n= Ä§/2T, \\nthen \\nthe total vacuum energy is: \\nEvac = Ä§ \\n/2T x TL/ lp2 \\n= Ä§ \\nL/(2 lp2). \\nThe vacu u\\nm energy density in three-\\ndimensional observed space is: \\nÏvac= Evac/(4Ï L3 /3) =  Ïp3lp2/(8 ÏL2). \\nHere Ïp is the Pl a\\nnck energy density,  \\nÏp \\n= Ep /lp3, \\nand Ep \\nis the Pl a\\nnck energy Ep = Ä§/tp \\n= 1.956 x 109 \\nJoule.  \\nThe\\n cosmological constant Îc \\nis: \\nÎc \\n= 8Ï Ïvac. Theref o\\nre \\nÎc \\n= 8Ï Ïvac \\n= 3Ïp \\nlp2/L2. \\nWe know that: \\nlp2/L2 =tp2/tu2 =10-122. \\nHere tu \\nis \\nthe age o f\\n the universe. We use: \\ntu \\n=13.799 billion years = 4.35 x 1017 \\nseconds.  \\nFrom this, we obtain: \\n                      \\n              Î \\n= 3 x10â122Ïp.  \\n Accord i\\nng to results published by the Planck \\nCollabo ra\\ntion in 2018 [Refs  15,16], the cosmological \\nconstant i s 2\\n.888 x 10-122 in Planck  u\\nnits. The result in \\n(17), Î = 3 x10â122Ïp, is consis t\\nent with the data from \\nthe Planc k\\n Collaboration in 2018 [Refs 15, 16] .  \\nInforma t\\nion Mechanics seems to be able to \\naddress the large hierarchy problem regarding the cosmological constant.  \\nXIII. \\nEmergence of th\\ne Electroweak Scale \\nand Planck Scale Hierarchy \\nThere a re\\n two outstanding hierarchy problems \\nin physics. One is the cosmological constant problem. \\nThe other is to derive the large difference between weak force and gravity, or equivalently between Higgs mass and Planck mass [Ref 17, 18, 19, 20]. We have shown above that Information Mechanics may help address the \\ncosmological constant problem; next, we will explore how it may help cope with the second hierarchy \\nproblem.  \\nTo derive the weak sc ale and Higgs mass in \\nInformation Mechanics, we study the information action \\nA\\n2 and write it \\nin\\n terms of complex coordinates, z, ð§ð§Ì, Î¸, \\nand ððÌ[Ref 4, 5]:  \\nA2= Î±ââ«dzdzï¿½ \\ndÎ¸ \\ndððÌ \\n= Î±â«d2z d2Î¸. \\nWe introd u\\nce observable space- time XÎ¼(z, \\nð§ð§Ì, Î¸, \\nÎ¸ï¿½) in s u\\nperspace, which includes both bosonic \\nspacetime  X \\nÎ¼(ðð, ð§ð§Ì) and i ts\\n fermionic counterpart ððÎ¼ \\n(ðð, \\nð§ð§Ì) and Ïï¿½Î¼(z, \\nð§ð§Ì): \\nX \\nÎ¼(z, ð§ð§Ì, Î¸, Î¸ï¿½) = X \\nÎ¼(ðð, ð§ð§Ì) + Î¸ððÎ¼ \\n(ðð, ð§ð§Ì) + Î¸ï¿½Ïï¿½Î¼(z, ð§ð§Ì)  + Î¸Î¸ï¿½F \\nÎ¼. \\nThe term FÎ¼ \\nis the au x\\niliary field, which can \\nusually be eliminated through equations of motion.  We \\nsuggest that bosonic space \\ntime XÎ¼(z, ð§ð§Ì) cor r\\nesponds to \\nobservable spacetime coordinates and the fermionic \\nspacetime ððÎ¼ \\n(z, ð§ð§Ì) and Ïï¿½Î¼(z, ð§ð§Ì) cor r\\nespond to \\nelementary particles.

And HÎ½ÏÏ(X) is \\nthe anti -symmetric tensor field strength.\\n To see how the hierarchy between Higgs mass \\nand Planck mass emerges, we use the\\n similarity \\nbetween Higgs mechanism and superconductivity. The \\nHiggs mechanism was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson when he noticed the similarity between \\nelectroweak symmetry breaking and superconductivity \\n[Ref 21, 22]. In the following, we show that in\\n Information \\nMechanics, one may use superconductor theory, BCS theory, to induce the large hierarchy between Planck \\nmass and Higgs mass.\\n Notice the observable space -time coordinates \\nX\\nÎ¼(ðð, ð§ð§Ì)consist  o\\nf a series of  vibrations. Similar to the \\nphonons in a superconductor interacting with fermions \\nthrough electromagnetic force, XÎ¼(ðð, ð§ð§Ì) vibrati o\\nns \\ninteract with fermions, gravity, and gauge interactions, \\nas indicated in the information action (18) through the interaction terms:\\n \\nVint\\n = GÎ¼Î½(X)ÏÎ¼\\n [ ÎÎ½ÏÏ(X) +1\\n2HÎ½ÏÏ(X) ]\\n ððð§ð§ÌXÏÏÏ+ GÎ¼Î½(X) \\nÏï¿½Î¼[ ÎÎ½ÏÏ(X) â12HÎ½ÏÏ(X) ] âzXÏ\\n Ïï¿½Ï\\n \\n                    + Â½ RÎ¼Î½ÏÏ(X)ÏÎ¼ÏÎ½Ïï¿½ÏÏï¿½Ï.     (19) \\nAs d\\niscovered in BCS theory, these  interactions  \\ncan add  a negative potential energy  which leads to a \\nground state with  the formation of coherent fermion \\npairs. This ground state energy results in a non- zero \\ngauge field, which breaks the gauge symmetry.   \\nIn the interaction terms (19), the gauge \\ninteraction is proportional to  ððð§ð§ÌXÏ and âzXÏ. This \\nindicates that the gro\\nund state with the formation of \\nfermion pairs will not only break gauge symmetry but \\nalso space -time translational symmetry. This means that \\nit can lead to space -time compactification and also \\nsuper  symmetry breaking. This may be a natural non -\\nperturbative mechanism for gauge symmetry breaking, space -time compactification, and super symmetry \\nbreaking.  \\nAccording to the BCS mechanism, the non -\\nperturbative ground state potential energy in the weak interaction limit is on the order of [Ref 21, 22]:  \\nW = - ncâððexp[-1\\nðððð]. \\nHere N  i\\ns the state density and V is the \\ninteraction potential. The energy term âððcorresponds to \\nthe energy of space -time vibration. It can be on the \\norder of the space -time compactification scale, which \\nmay be of the same energy scale as the super \\nsymmetry breaking. One can see that the Higgs mass is exponentially smaller than the space -time compactifi -\\ncation scale.  Because of the exponential form of the non -\\nperturbative potential energy in the ground state, the large  hierarchy between Higgs mass and compactifica -\\ntion scale and thus Planck scale can be easily generated. We will expand the detailed model, \\ncalculation,  and discussion of this possible scheme in \\nfuture work.  \\nXIV.  \\nBlack Holes \\nAny fundamental physics th\\neory including \\ngravity should be able to address  what is happening \\ninside a black hole. Letâs take a look at how Information \\nMechanics could help us study what is inside a  black \\nhole.  \\nA black hole is created when the gravity force \\nbecomes stronger than the fermion ic exclusion force,  \\nand matter is collapsed by gravity to the point that all matter including light is confined to a limited space and time [Ref 23, 24]. Thus, we propose that a black hole is related to physical space -time compactification in the \\nobservabl e four -dimensional space -time.  \\nIn Information Mechanics, to study black holes, \\nwe can start with the action (18):  \\nA\\n2 = Î±â«d2z[(GÎ¼v+ BÎ¼v) âzXÎ¼ððð§ð§ÌXv+ GÎ¼Î½(X)(ÏÎ¼ ð·ð·ð§ð§ÌÏÎ½+ Ïï¿½Î¼DzÏï¿½v) \\n+ Â½ RÎ¼Î½ÏÏ(X)ÏÎ¼ÏÎ½Ïï¿½ÏÏï¿½Ï]. \\nIn the case of a b lack hole, GÎ¼v \\nand R Î¼Î½ÏÏ(X) \\nbecome v e\\nry large, \\nand we assume this leads to \\ncompactification of space -time in the observable four -\\ndimensional space -time. This means that: \\nX0 â \\nX0 + D0\\n, \\nXi â \\nXi+ Di, i = 1,2,3. \\nIn\\naction A2(18), this sp a\\nce-time \\ncompactification will lead to a positive kinetic energy: \\n            (GÎ¼v+ BÎ¼v) âzXÎ¼ððð§ð§ÌXvâ \\n(GÎ¼v+ BÎ¼v) 1\\nð·ð·ðð1\\nð·ð·ðð \\n    (19) \\nThis ad d\\nitional kinetic energy term will balance \\nthe negative potential energy from the gravity and gauge interaction term: \\nGÎ¼Î½(X)ÏÎ¼ \\n[ ÎÎ½ÏÏ(X) +1\\n2HÎ½ÏÏ(X) ] ððð§ð§ÌXÏðððð+ GÎ¼Î½(X)Ïï¿½Î¼[ ÎÎ½ÏÏ(X) â \\n12HÎ½ÏÏ(X) ] \\nâzXÏ \\nÏï¿½Ï \\n+  Â½ RÎ¼Î½ÏÏ(X)ÏÎ¼ÏÎ½Ïï¿½ÏÏï¿½Ï \\n                                (20)     \\nThe bala n\\nce between the kinetic energy  in (19) \\nand the potential energy in (20) could lead  to a new \\nstable ground state. It indicates that the internal \\nstructure of a black hole is similar to a crystal, or liquid crystal, or some other ordered and coherent state. The action A\\n2 can enable us to study the\\n detailed dynamics \\ninside a black hole with matter, space -time, gravity, and \\ngauge interactions all present in one formula. We will defer the detailed calculation and discussion to future work.         \\n               \\n                          \\n                     1 Global Journal ofScience Frontier Research        Volume XX  Issue        ersion I VXIV Year2020\\n29\\n   (A)\\nÂ©2 0 20 Global JournalsInformat i\\non Mechanics : The Dynamics of âIt from Bitâ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\3-Information-Mechanics-The-Dynamics.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='To study  th\\ne dynamics outside of the black \\nhole, the measurement scale L is larger than the horizon \\nof the black hole. For an observer outside a black hole,  \\na black hole appears as a particle with specific mass and spin.  \\nLike everything, a black hole carries information. \\nFor an outside obs erver, the entropy of a black hole is \\nthe unknown information or possibilities associated with the black hole. Since the outside observer canât receive any information beyond the horizon of a black hole, the information space scale, L, for the observation  of a \\nblack hole is the black holeâs horizon.

We propose that information determines the observed phenomena. The interaction of basic yin yang elements making up information and everything creates the observed phenomena. We derive the information action and information function. We show that the observed phenomena, such as physical space time, elementary \\nparticles and their wave -particle duality, fundamental \\nforces, classical equations of motion, dark matter, and dark energy, may emerge from the information action and information f unction. We show how classical \\nphysics, quantum physics, quantum field theory, and string theory may emerge in information Mechanics. We discover that it is possible to derive a value of the cosmological constant consistent with astrophysical observation. We suggest a plausible scheme to derive \\nthe hierarchy between the weak scale and the Planck scale using information action. We indicate that one can \\nstudy what is inside a black hole and deduce that the \\nentropy of a black hole to an outside observer is proportional to the area of the event horizon.  Information Mechanics appears to be promising \\nto address various challenging problems facing theoretical physics.  More detailed calculations and \\nfurther investigation are still needed.

In this work, we will review the nature of the debate andpropose a new way to address the controversies about the non-deterministic and subjectivenature of quantum physics. In our previous work, we have shown that everything is made of\\ninformation, energy and matter. We propose to deÂ¯ne spirit or soul as the content of infor-\\nmation, spiritual heart as the receiver of information, and mind as the processor of information.In this paper, we show that the intrinsic uncertain and non-deterministic nature of quantum\\nphysics can be explained by the insights from these deÂ¯nitions. Information relates to the\\npossibilities and potentialities of an object. Information is intrinsically uncertain and non-deterministic. Since quantum physics is the fundamental physics theory describing the infor-mation, energy and matter of everything, quantum physics has intrinsic an uncertain and non-\\ndeterministic nature. We further demonstrate that the process of quantum measurement can be\\ninterpreted as the role played by soul, spiritual heart and mind in the manifestation of physicalphenomena. We conclude that our insight that everything is made of information, energy andmatter and the deÂ¯nition of soul, spiritual heart and mind provides a simple metaphysical\\ninterpretation of quantum physics.

Introduction\\nQuantum physics is the most fundamental theory of physics. Quantum physics is the\\nstudy of what everything is made of and how it behaves at the atomic and subatomic\\nlevels.1â4Classical physics, including Newtonian mechanics, classical electromagne-\\ntism and thermodynamics as well as Einstein\\'s relativity theories describe the\\nmacroscopic world. It has been shown that classical physics is an approximation of\\nquantum physics. Quantum physics yields the most accurate predictions about na-\\nture and has led to many great advances in science and technology.\\nHowever, the basis of quantum physics is still not well understood, because it\\nchallenges the foundations of physics and natural science at their core. The meta-\\nphysical interpretation of quantum physics is an ongoing debate.\\nStudies in quantum physics indicate that everything is made of various vibra-\\ntions, also called waves. Vibrations or waves are periodic oscillations. Because\\nquantum vibrations are not limited by space and time, everything according to\\nquantum physics is basically a vibrational Â¯eld consisting of diÂ®erent vibrations.\\nThese vibrational Â¯elds are described mathematically by a \\\\wave function\". A wave\\nfunction is the mathematical formula that expresses the properties and quantities of\\nvibrations or waves of an object.\\nThe Â¯rst controversy about quantum physics is related to the question\\nof whether the world we observe is deterministic or not. In classical physics,\\neverything is described by equations of motion. They are deterministic, meaning that\\ntheory can predict what happens in the future if you know the current or past state of\\nan object. Quantum physics is fundamentally non-deterministic. In quantum phys-\\nics, everything is described by wave functions, which can only tell the possibilities\\nand chance for certain things to happen. Because of the probabilistic nature of\\nquantum physics, some scientists, including Albert Einstein, do not accept quantum\\nphysics as the fundamental theory of physics. The measurement problem in quantum\\nphysics involves the debate about why our world appears to be deÂ¯nite while the\\nunderlying quantum nature is the superposition of many possible vibrational states.\\nThe second controversy about quantum physics is that the concept of\\nquantum phenomena drastically conÂ°icts with one of the cornerstones ofnatural science and scientiÂ¯c research, which is objectivity. It is generally\\naccepted in natural science that natural phenomena are objective. Their existence\\ndoes not depend on the action of the observer. In quantum physics, however, phe-\\nnomena are subjective and depend on the action of observers and the measurement\\nprocess. For instance, in quantum physics, the measurement of the location of a light\\nparticle depends on where the observer put the detector. The measurement of the\\npolarization of a light depends on how the observer directs the polarizer.\\nThe above two distinguishing and other qualities such as non-local eÂ®ect existing\\nin quantum physics have caused many scientists to question whether quantumphysics is a complete or correct theory about reality. Many interpretations have been\\nproposed to make sense of quantum physics, such as the Copenhagen interpretation,Z. G. Sha & R. Xiu\\n1850002-2\\nRep. Adv. Phys. Sci. 2018.02.

Interpretations of\\nquantum mechanics deal with two problems: (1) how to relate the mathematical\\nformalism to the experimental facts, and (2) how to state the physical meaning of the\\nmathematical formulations and experimental phenomena in terms of ordinary un-derstanding, as well as in philosophical and metaphysical terms.\\nThe generally accepted Copenhagen interpretation\\n1,4of quantum physics discards\\nthe idea of the objectiveness of physical reality and reduces physics to a subjective\\ndiscipline that only deals with our knowledge of physical reality. To maintain the\\ndeterministic and objective nature of reality, the pilot-wave theory, also called de\\nBroglie âBohm theory and the causal interpretation,5postulates an actual conÂ¯gu-\\nration that exists even when unobserved, in addition to a wave function.

In our previous work,9we have shown that everything is made of infor-\\nmation, energy and matter.

Matter, Energy and Information\\nTo truly understand both our existence and quantum physics, we suggest that we\\nshould Â¯rst understand what everything is made of. In our previous paper, we\\ndemonstrate that everyone is made of matter, energy and information.\\nHere, we consider matter as everything we can measure and observe. For example,\\nlength, width, height, distance, weight, mass, charge, electric Â¯eld, spin, force and\\nmany more are all diÂ®erent properties and phenomena of matter.\\nEnergy is the ability to move and change matter, such as lifting a weight or\\nheating up a pot of water.\\nInformation is that which informs. It gives form to the phenomenon we observe.\\nFor instance, information in our bank determines how much money we have. The\\nblueprint of a house determines the shape and dimensions of the house.

A New Way to Interpret the Controversies in Quantum Physics\\nWe suggest that the insight that everything is made of information, energy and\\nmatter and the deÂ¯nitions of soul, heart and mind as three components of infor-mation inside something yield a new way to address the controversies in quantum\\nphysics in simple terms.\\nLet us Â¯rst address the controversy about the intrinsic uncertainty and non-\\ndeterministic nature of quantum physics. We propose that the reason quantum\\nphysics is intrinsically uncertain and non-deterministic is due to the fact that ev-\\nerything is made of information, energy and matter. Here by matter, we mean what\\nwe see, hear and observe. Energy is what moves and changes the matter. Matter and\\nenergy are discussed in all physics theories. According to Claude Shannon's discovery\\nof Information Theory,\\n11information describes and measures the possibilities and\\npotentialities within an object. Information is intrinsically probabilistic. If infor-\\nmation is one of the basic constituents of everything, everything has fundamentally\\nan uncertain and non-deterministic nature. The information aspect is addressed in\\nquantum physics and thermodynamics. This is why quantum physics, as the fun-\\ndamental theory about how everything works at the microscopic level, is funda-\\nmentally uncertain and non-deterministic. We conclude the insight that everything\\nis made of information, energy and matter can explain why the fundamental nature\\nof quantum physics is uncertain and non-deterministic.\\nRegarding the controversy about the subjective nature of quantum physics, we\\nsuggest that our deÂ¯nitions of soul, spiritual heart and mind may explain why\\nquantum phenomena are intrinsically subjective. This is related to how the quantumphenomena are determined by soul, spiritual heart and mind.\\nIn quantum physics, one needs to use detector or detectors to observe a quantum\\nphenomenon.

Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we show that the intrinsic uncertain and non-deterministic nature of\\nquantum physics can be explained by the insight that everything consists of informa-\\ntion, energy and matter. Information relates to the possibilities and potentialities of an\\nobject. Quantum physics is the fundamental theory of physics that describes the in-\\nformation, energy and matter of everything. Because of this, quantum physics has an\\nintrinsic uncertain and non-deterministic nature. We demonstrate that with the deÂ¯-\\nnition of soul, spiritual heart and mind as the content, receiver and processor of infor-\\nmation, the measuring process of quantum phenomenon can be interpreted as the rolethat soul, spiritual heart and mind play in the manifestation of physical phenomena.\\nWe conclude that our insight that everything is made of information, energy and\\nmatter and the deÂ¯nitions of soul, spiritual heart and mind provide a simple meta-\\nphysical interpretation of quantum physics.

However, modern medicine \\noften only treats the symptoms of a disease and does not address the root cause. Based on our previous work on a \\nmathematical definition of life, we propose a new scientif ic definition for sickness as the drastic increase of \\nnegative information and decrease of positive information in a certain aspect, a certain part, and a certain area of a \\nliving system. The healing process increases positive info rmation and decreases negative information. We show \\nthat this new insight about sickness and healing can help to heal more sicknesse s at the root cause , and can facilitate \\nthe development of a new science of healing.  \\nKeywords: definition of sickness, definition of healing, positive information, definition of life, purpose of life, \\nnegative information, science of healing, science of life \\nIntroduction \\nModern medicine has made many breakthroughs that have significantly prolonged life. However, modern \\nmedicine mostly addresses and controls symptoms, and does  not cure a sickness at the root cause. Furthermore, \\nmodern natural science has not been able to provide a proper conceptual framework to study the effect of consciousness on health and well-being. \\nIn our previous work (Sha & Xiu,  2018-1), we show that, from the quantum physics point of view, \\neveryone and everything is the vibrational field which carries three elements: matter, energy, and information. \\nHere, we regard matter as what we observe in the physical reality, such  as our body and its cells, organs, \\nmolecules, and atoms. Energy is what moves and chan ges matter. Information gives shape and form to matter \\nand energy. Information has three aspects: content of in formation, receiver of information, and processor of \\ninformation. We suggest the content of information relates to our soul and spirit, the receiver of information relates to the spiritual heart, and the processor of information relates to our mind. We discovered that this insight can explain spiritual phenomena and wisdom in a scientific way within the framework of quantum physics. For instance, we find that these concepts can ex plain why and how our physical reality is manifested \\nby our soul, spiritual heart, and mind. It explains why and how clairvoyance, telepathy, and spiritual healing work and how to develop these abilities.  \\n                                                       \\n \\nZhi Gang Sha, Dr., Institute of Soul Hea ling and Enlightenment, Richmond Hill, Canada. \\nRulin Xiu, Ph.D., Research Director,  Hawaii Theoretical Physics Research Center, Ha waii, USA; Institute of Soul Healing and \\nEnlightenment, Richmond Hill, Canada. DAVID  PUBLISHING  D ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\A New Scientific Definition of Sickness and Healing.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='A NEW SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION OF SICKNESS AND HEALING \\n\\xa0479\\nTo study and describe life in a quantitative way, in our recent work (Sha & Xiu, 2018-2) we introduce the \\nconcept of positive information and negative information into physics. We define positive information as the \\norder a system has within itself and the degree of connection that a system has with other systems. In contrast to positive information, negative information is the disorder and degree of disconnection of a system. Negative information corresponds to the concept of entropy already defined and studied in current science. In Sha and Xiu (2018-2), we present a method to calculate positive information and the mathematical formula for positive information. In Sha and Xiu (2018-3), we explore how to use positive information to study a living system. We suggest that positive information provides a way to give life a quantitative definition. We propose that life is a system that can maintain, enhance, and develop positive information. This leads to the natural conclusion that the purpose of life is to enhance and develop more positive information. We suggest that positive information may play a significant role in studying living systems and phenomena. \\nIn this paper, we show that the concept and understanding of positive information and negative \\ninformation can give us a deeper understanding and definition of sickness. We propose that we can scientifically define sickness as the state having a dr astic increase of negative information and decrease of \\npositive information. This insight explains how consciou sness and environment affect  our health and how some \\ntypes of spiritual healing work. It also expands the concept of sickness beyond physical sickness to emotional, mental, and spiritual sickness as well as sickness in relationships, finances, career, and more. It can also help us discover more advanced healing methods that can remove all sickness at the root cause.  \\nScientific Definition of  Sickness and Healing \\nIn our previous work, we define life as a system that can maintain, develop, and enhance positive \\ninformation. Positive information is the order and connection within a system. It is easy to see that order and connection is what gives rise to good health, good relationships, and success in business, career, and every aspect of our lives. Negative information, or disorder and disconnection, manifest as sickness, difficulties, and challenges in our lives. We can thus define sickness in the following scientific way: âSickness in a living system is the drastic increase of negative informatio n and decrease of positive information within a certain \\naspect, a certain area, or a certain part of the body of the living systemâ.  \\nThis scientific definition for sickness is significant in  three ways. First, this definition for sickness includes \\nnot only physical sickness, but also emotional, ment al, and spiritual sickness, as well as difficulties and \\nchallenges in relationships, finances, career, and more. S econd, this definition of sickness tells us directly the \\nroot cause of all sickness, difficulties, and challenges. They are due to the lack of positive information and increase of negative information. Third, this new definition of sickness can explain why and how our consciousness can manifest sickness. For instance, suppose one thinks one is loved by everyone and everything. This state of consciousness will lead one to connect at deeper levels with everyone and everything, and an \\nincrease in oneâs positive information. This in turn will make one healthier and have better relationships, finances, and more success in oneâs life. On the other hand, if one thinks and feels that one is not loved by others and the world, this will reduce oneâs connection with others and the world. This will increase oneâs negative information and lead to sickness in health and difficulties in relationships, finances, career, and other aspects of life.  \\nBased on the above scientific definition of sickness, we can easily give the following scientific definition \\nfor healing: âTo heal is to change the negative information in a system into positive informationâ. ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\A New Scientific Definition of Sickness and Healing.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='A NEW SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION OF SICKNESS AND HEALING \\n\\xa0480 \\nFrom this insight about sickness and healing, we can understand and explain why and how different kinds \\nof healing modalities work. For instance, current western medicine treats the physical body to enhance positive \\ninformation. Traditional Chinese medicine mostly ba lances energy to increase positive information.  \\nOne can also heal all sickness including improvements in health, relationships, finances, and intelligence \\nby enhancing positive information and reducing negative information through directly changing oneâs soul, spiritual heart, and mind. Let us call them soul healing, heart healing, and mind healing, respectively.  \\nSoul is the content of information. Everyone and ev erything is the vibrational field according to quantum \\nphysics. Our vibrational field contains a lot of info rmation not in our conscious awareness, including \\ninformation about what we have done and what our parents and ancestors have done. This hidden information secretly controls our life. To change  our life, we need to transform the hidden negative information within us \\ninto positive information. We can thus define soul healing as: âSoul healing is the enhancement of positive information by changing the content of information in oneâs vibrational fieldâ.  \\nThe placebo effect is one of the most basic forms of soul healing. Tests of the efficacy of a new medical \\ntreatment compare the use of a given treatment to a fake  treatment. The fake treatment is called a âplaceboâ. \\nMany research studies have found the placebo to be a valuable treatment for many sicknesses. The placebo effect is the most basic kind of soul healing. In the pl acebo treatment, patients receive the positive message that \\nthey have received medical treatment. The efficacy of th e placebo for healing demonstrates that giving positive \\ninformation for soul healing is a valuable treatment.  \\nMore advanced soul healing techniques include chanting, evocation, praying, downloads, transmissions, \\nforgiveness practice, an d distant healing.  \\nSpiritual heart is the receiver of information from the soul. We can thus define heart healing as the \\nenhancement of positive information by receiving positive  information. Feeling and receiving love is a good \\nway to heal all sickness. Offering and receiving forgiveness, compassion, light, humility, harmony, gratitude, and service are also powerful ways of heart healing.  \\nMind is the processor of information. Mind healing enhances positive information by effectively \\nprocessing information. Understanding and applying wisdom is proven an effective way to heal all sickness, including health, relationships, finances, intelligence, and more. \\nSoul, heart, and mind healing is different from current medical treatment in the three ways: First, soul, \\nheart, and mind healing each  address the root cause of all sickness  and challenges, basically transforming \\nnegative information into positive information. Physical and energetic healing methods, such as current medicine and normal traditional Chinese medicine can only address the symptoms of sickness at the physical and energetic levels.  \\nSecond, current medical treatments usually require direct  physical touch, input, or interaction. Soul, heart, \\nand mind healing can take place over distance without direct  physical intervention. Third, soul, heart, and mind \\nhealing can be applied to every aspect of oneâs life, including the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of our existence, as well as our relationships, fi nances, and more. Current medical treatments are mostly \\non the physical level. Their effect on other aspects of our lives is rather limited.  \\nDeveloping Advanced Healing Techniques \\nOur scientific definitions of sickness and healing offer not only deeper insight and a broader view about \\nsickness and healing, but can also bring us better and more advanced healing modalities.

Additionally, the vibrational field carrying high level positive information is \\ndownloaded into each Tao Calligraphy. When people connect with it or even better trace it, the calligraphy helps transform their negative information into positive information. Through this, Tao Calligraphy has helped people heal their own or otherâs physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual sickness as well as difficulties and challenges in relationships, finances, career, and every aspect of life in profound ways.  \\nHere, we share two cases.  The first case regards phy sical sickness. Gayle is a publisher and film-maker. \\nOne day, her daughter phoned her and told her the heartbreaking news that she was diagnosed with stage four cancers. Luckily, Gayle knew about Tao Calligraphy. She immediately got a Tao Calligraphy with special blessings for her daughter. With the help of Tao Calligraphy, her daughter became cancer free within two weeks.  \\nDavid Meltzer, the president of Sports 1 Marketing Company, traced a Tao Calligraphy for 15 minutes \\neach day before going to work with the intention of expanding his business. His business experienced \\nexponential growth, from five employees to 55 employees within a short time.  \\nConclusion \\nIn this paper, we show that sickness can be given a sc ientific definition as the drastic increase of negative \\ninformation and decrease of positive information in a certai n aspect, a certain part, or a certain area of a living \\nsystem. This new definition of sickness can describe and explain not only physical sickness, emotional sickness, mental sickness, and spiritual sickness, but also the sickness in relationships, finances, career, intelligence, and every aspect of life. It also gives us deeper insight ab out the root cause of all sickness and difficulties in our \\nlives. It also brings a broader and deeper insight and definition of healing as increasing positive information and decreasing negative information. This new scientific definition and insight about healing can explain why the placebo effect and spiritual healing practices, such as chanting, reciting positive messages, and praying work. It also helps us develop better healing approaches that can heal all sickness at the root cause. We show case studies of one such healing technique, Tao Calligraphy. We will present further studies and research on this in our future work.  \\nReferences \\nSha, Z. G., & Xiu, R. L. (2018-1).

It was originally introduced by Albert Einstein as an \\naddition to his theory of general relativity to \"hold back gravity\" and achieve a static universe. The Hubbleâs 1929 discovery that galaxies are moving away from each other implies an overall expanding universe. Studies and observation data in physics, astrophysics, and cosmology indicates that our universe starts from a big bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation, an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 billion years ago [1-3]. From 1929 until the early 1990s, most cosmology researchers assumed the cosmological constant to be zero.\\nSince the 1990s, several new discoveries in observational cosmology, \\nespecially the discovery of the accelerating universe from distant supernovae in 1998 in addition to independent evidence from the cosmic microwave background and large galaxy redshift surveys have shown that around 68.3% of the mass-energy density of the universe is due to dark energy [4-9] and around 26.8% is due to dark matter. Dark energy is an unknown energy source that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Dark matter is an unknown matter source that is necessary to account for the observed large-scale structure in our universe. The cosmological constant is the simplest possible form of dark energy. Current standard model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM model, assumes non-zero cosmological constant as the source of dark energy. It provides a good fit to many cosmological observations as of 2016 with the cosmological constant to be on the order of 10\\nâ52\\xa0mâ2 in metric units. In terms of Planck unit, and as a \\nnatural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant is calculated to be on the order of 10\\nâ121 [9].\\nThe cosmological constant problem is the disagreement between \\nthe observed small value of cosmological constant and the theoretical non-zero vacuum energy as suggested by the quantum field theory. Depending on the assumptions, the discrepancy ranges from 40 to more than 100 orders of magnitude. Hobson and Efstathiou [10] describe this as \"the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics\". \\nSome theorists resort to supersymmetric theories to solve the \\ncosmological constant problem. Supersymmetry is the symmetry between the particles with integer spin (bosonic particles) and the particles with half spin (fermionic particles). Supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant to be exactly zero. This does not solve the non-zero cosmological constant problem [11-13].Another theoretical approach that attempts to solve the cosmological \\nconstant problem is multiverse theories [14,15]. Multiverse theory \\npostulates a large number of \"parallel\" universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. One uses anthropic principle and prior probability distribution for cosmological constant over the multiverse to find the most probable value that allows galaxies to form. The anthropic principle is the philosophical consideration that observation of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it [16-18]. The argument is that only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed. \\nIn this paper, we will study dark energy, dark matter, and \\ncosmological constant in the framework of universal wave function interpretation of string theory. As previously said string theory is a mathematically consistent theory that can incorporate both quantum theory and general relativity [11-13]. Quantum physics has been proven to be the fundamental physics for all elementary particles and three fundamental forces, electromagnetic, weak and strong forces. General Relativity is the proven theory for gravity. Many ways are proposed to incorporate gravity and general relativity into quantum physics. The grand unification theory, also called the theory of everything, is the attempt to use one mathematic formula to explain all the fundamental forces and matters discovered so far and to integrate quantum physics and general relativity together. String theory is a promising candidate for the grand unification theory [11-13]. \\nHow to understand and apply string theory has been a long debated \\nsubject. The currently accepted interpretation is that string theory studies the quantum dynamics of a string. The vibration of string creates particles and interactions. The scale of the string is set to be Planck Scale \\n*Corresponding author: Rulin Xiu, Hawaii Theoretical Physics Research\\nCenter, 16-266 E.

The observed large-scale structure of our universe indicates the existence of an unknown \\nmatter source, dark matter. Cosmological constant, a constant term related to the vacuum energy appearing in the equation of gravitational field, is the simplest possible form of dark energy. String theory is one of the few mathematically consistent theories that can unify quantum physics and general relativity. In this work, we present a new way to derive and interpret string theory. We show that this new interpretation of string theory can explain the source of dark energy and dark matter. It may provide a way to calculate cosmological constant consistent with the current data.

The finite size of the string length \\nhelps result in a consistent theory for all forces, including gravity. The \\nachievement of string theory cannot be overestimated. This theory has the potential to predict the dimension of space-time, the particle and interaction spectrum, to unify all the forces and fundamental particles, and more. However, with all these great potentials and promises, string theory has not yet made many testable predictions. Something is still missing in our understanding of string theory. \\nIn this work, using both quantum physics and general relativity, \\nwe obtain an uncertainty relationship (also called duality relationship) between space and time. From this relationship, we derive a new way to understand and apply string theory, the universal wave function interpretation of string theory (UWFIST). In quantum physics, everything is made of various waves and described by wave function. Wave function reveals the quality and quantities of the waves inside a system. We will show that our universal wave function interpretation of string theory provides a way to calculate the wave function of our universe. From the wave function of our universe, we can calculate the vacuum energy of our universe. We will demonstrate that using the age of our universe and fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant G, Planck constant Ä§, and speed of light, UWFIST provides a new way to understand the dark energy. It may yield the estimate of cosmological constant consistent with the current experimental observation. \\nA New Way to Derive and Interpret String Theory\\nQuantum physics has completely changed our views about space-\\ntime in a way even more dramatic than the way Einstein has changed our view about space-time. According to quantum physics, how accurate we can measure time and space depends on the amount of energy and momentum we use. It takes energy and momentum to measure time and space. More specifically, according to quantum physics, to measure the time of duration âÏ, it takes the energy âE ~ Ä§/âÏ. Similarly, to measure space of size âÏ, it takes the momentum âP ~ Ä§/âÏ. Here Ä§ is the reduced Planck Constant, Ä§ = h/2Ï. And h is the Planck Constant. It is equal to 6.626 Ã 10\\nâ34 joul-second.\\nIf one takes gravity into consideration, when one measures time \\ninterval âÏ, the energy âE used for time measurement will curve the space-time according to general relativity. It will create a black hole with the horizon on the order of GâE/c\\n4. Here G is the gravitational \\nconstant with the value approximately 6.674Ã10â11\\xa0N-m2/kg2 and c is \\nthe speed of light with the value approximately 3 Ã 108 meter/second. \\nWhen âÏ is smaller than GâE/c4, no information can come out. \\nTherefore, the measurable causal region is: \\nâÏ â¥ GâE/c4\\nFrom this, we find the condition for the causal region when we take \\nboth quantum effect and gravity into consideration is: \\n âÏ âÏ â¥ lp tp                                                                                                                            (1)\\nHere lp is the Planck length, lp = (Ä§G/c3)1/2 = 1.616 Ã 10-35 meter. And \\ntp is the Planck time, tp = (Ä§G/c5)1/2 = 5.39 Ã 10-44 second. This condition \\nindicates an uncertainty relation between space âÏ and time âÏ in causal region. This relation is sometimes called duality relation. We suggest that this relation indicates that space and time are quantized \\nand the non-commutation relation between space and time:\\n [Ï, Ï] = i l\\nptp                                                                     (2)\\nUsing the quantization procedure in quantum physics [19], we propose that the space time uncertainty relation (1) and non-\\ncommutation relation (2) indicates an action As in the form:\\n As = ÊdÏdÏ/lptp                                                                                                                                              (3)\\nAction As evolves the wave function from Ï (0,0) at the space 0 and \\ntime 0 to Ï (L,T) at the space L and time T in the following way:\\nÏ (L,T) = Î£ sum over all possible paths  exp (i Ê0T dÏ Ê0LdÏ/lptp) Ï \\n(0,0)                                                                                        (4)\\nIt is interesting to note that action (3) is a string action [11-13]. \\nThis demonstrates from another angle that when we take gravity into consideration, it is necessary to use a âstringâ action (3) instead of âparticleâ action \\nA = Ê dÏ to obtain a consistent theory. We introduced the universal \\nwave function Ï (L,T) in equation (4). We call equation (4) the universal wave function interpretation of string theory (UWFIST). \\nUWFIST deviates from the usual interpretation of string theory in \\ntwo ways. Firstly, the world-sheet space Ï and time Ï integration of the action (3) is over the causal region. i.e.,\\nA\\ns = Ê0T dÏ Ê0LdÏ/lp2 \\nHere T and L are the age and length of the causal horizon. In the \\nnormal interpretation of string theory, Ï is the string coordinate. L is taken to be the length of the string. It is set to be Planck length l\\np. In the \\nformula (4), Ï and Ï represent proper space and time. T and L are now variables. They change as universe evolves or as space and time pass by. The second difference between the usual string theory and UWFIST is that the universal wave function Î¨ (L,T) are introduced. Here Î¨ (0,0) and Î¨ (L,T) represents the universal wave function at the initial space and time and at the space L and time T. We propose that the universal wave function could be the wave function of our universe. This is because if we extend the string action to the cases of superstring and heterotic string with background fields, the universal wave function Î¨ can include all fundamental particles; all gauge interactions, gravity, and more. It also includes the large structures of our universe up to the scale of horizon. In other words, UWFIST could be the wave function of our universe. Except for these two major conceptual differences, the usual string theory calculation can still be applied in UWFIST. \\nIn the string theory, there are two sets of space-time: the \\n2-dimensional world-sheet (Ï, Ï) and the observed space-time X\\nÎ¼ (Ï, Ï). \\nThe observed space-time XÎ¼ (Ï,Ï) is a projection from the world sheet \\nto possibly a higher dimensional space-time. In terms of XÎ¼ (Ï,Ï), the \\naction As in (3) becomes:\\nAs = (1/lptp) ÊdÏdÏ g1/2gab âaXÎ¼âbXÎ¼                   (5)\\nHere gÎ±Î² is the metric tensor on the world-sheet formed by proper \\nspace and time (Ï, ) and g = -det gÎ±Î². As shown in string theory (Ref 1,2), \\nthe general form of action (5) in the presence of massless background field is in the form:\\nA\\ns = [iÎ± Ê0T dÏ Ê0L dÏ g1/2 (gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + ÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + 1/4Î± Î¦ \\nR)]                                                                                                (6)\\nHere GÎ¼Î½ (Ï, Ï), BÎ¼Î½ (Ï, Ï), Î¦ (Ï, Ï) are metric tensor, anti-symmetric \\ntensor, and scalar background fields of the observed space. And R is the scalar curvature related to g\\nÎ±Î². The universal wave function in the \\npresence of background fields is:\\nÎ¨ (XÎ¼ (L,T), GÎ¼Î½ (L,T), BÎ¼Î½ (L,T), Î¦ (L,T)) = â«DXÎ¼ DgÎ¼Î½ DBÎ¼Î½ DÎ¦ exp[iÎ± Ê0T \\ndÏ Ê0L dÏ g1/2 (gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + ÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + 1/4Î± Î¦ R)]                            (7)', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Dark Energy and Estimate of Cosmological Constant from String Theory.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Citation: Xiu R (2017) Dark Energy and Estimate of Cosmological Constant from String Theory.

We can also extend the above string action to \\nthe cases of superstring and heterotic string to include all fundamental particles, all gauge interactions, gravity, and more. This universal wave function tells us the probability for our universe to be at space-time coordinate X\\nÎ¼ (L,T) and background fields GÎ¼Î½ (L,T), BÎ¼Î½ (L,T), \\nÎ¦ (L,T). We can do a Fourier transformation to transform the wave function Î¨ (X\\nÎ¼ (L,T), GÎ¼Î½ (L,T), BÎ¼Î½ (L,T), Î¦ (L,T) to be expressed in \\nthe vibrational space expressed by the various vibrations (ÏÎ¼,ÎºÎ¼Î½,â¦). \\nThe wave function Î¨ (ÏÎ¼ (L,T),ÎºÎ¼Î½ (L,T),â¦) expresses what kind of \\nvibrations in our universe and how much they exist at proper time T and horizon length L in our universe. \\nExistence of Dark Energy and Dark Matter\\nA natural indication and consequence of UWFIST is the existence \\nof dark energy and dark matter. The space-time coordinate XÎ¼ (Ï, Ï) is \\ncomposed of vibrations in the form exp [iÏn (Ï+cÏ)/L] and exp [iÏn \\n(Ï-cÏ)/L]. Here n is an integer. Unlike the normal string theory, in \\nwhich L is the Planck length, now L is causal horizon distance. The largest wavelength is on the order of the length of the causal horizon. \\nThese vibrations are very fine. They are very dark in the sense that it \\nis very difficult to detect them. In fact, to detect the vibration with the wavelength L, it takes the time L/c. If L is the horizon distance, \\nthis means that it takes the time of the age of the visible universe or a \\ndetector as large as the whole visible universe to detect these vibrations. The existence of these vibrations may explain the existence of dark energy.\\nThere also exist vibrations with small masses, which can be as small \\nas h/(Lc). These are extremely small masses. The existence of these \\nvibrations with extremely small masses may explain the existence of dark matter. Similar to the vibrations that cause dark energy, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to directly detect these massive vibrations. \\nAn Estimate of Vacuum Energy and Cosmological Constant\\nNow we are going to calculate the vacuum energy density in our \\nobserved space-time in the framework of UWFIST. Here we define \\nthe vacuum energy to be the lowest energy state of the universal wave \\nfunction. Because our observed universe is the projection from the world-sheet, the world sheet contains all the information, energy, and \\nmatter about our universe. All the vibrations in the observed space time \\ncome from the vibrations in the world-sheet. Therefore, we simply need to calculate the vacuum energy in the two-dimensional world sheet. \\nTo calculate the vacuum energy of the world-sheet, letâs assume that \\non the world-sheet, the energy is in the form of harmonic oscillator. The \\nenergy at the state (n,m) with the frequency Î½\\nn = n/T and wavelength \\nÎ»m = L/m is:\\nEn,m = (n + Â½) h/T.\\nThe lowest energy of this vacuum fluctuation is E0n,m = h/2T. \\nThe number of possible vibrations on the world sheet is TL/\\n(tplp). We can get this from the uncertainty relation (1). To make the \\nspace measurement âÏ, we should at least use the vibration with the \\nwavelength Î»m = L/m ~ âÏ. To measure the time measurement âÏ, we \\nshould at least use the vibration with the frequency Î½n = n/T ~ âÏ. Since \\nâÏ âÏ â¥ lp tp, we get nm < TL/(tplp). \\nThe total lowest vacuum energy is:\\nEvac = h/2T Ã TL/lp2 = hL/(2 lp2).                 (8)It is proportional to the length of the causal horizon. The lowest \\nvacuum energy density in the three dimensional space is:\\nÏvac = Evac/(4Ï L3/3) = Ïp lp2/(2L2)                                       (9)\\nHere Ïp is the Planck energy density, \\nÏp = Ep/(4Ï lp3/3) and Ep is the Planck energy Ep = Ä§/tp = 1.956 Ã 109 \\nJoul, tp and lp are the Planck time and Planck length lp = c tp = (Ä§G/c3)1/2. \\nThe equation (5) tells us that the vacuum energy density observed \\nin three-dimensional space is inversely proportional to the square of \\nthe length of horizon L. \\nThe cosmological constant is defined as: Îc = 8Ï Ïvac. \\nTherefore,\\nÎc = 8Ï Ïvac = 4Ï Ïp lp2/L2\\nWe know that:l\\np2/L2 ~ tp2/tu2 ~ 10-122,\\nHere tu is the age of the universe. We use:\\ntu =13.799 billion years = 4.35 Ã 1017 second. \\nFrom this, we obtain:Î\\nc = 4Ï Ïp tp2/tu2 ~ 10-121 Ïp\\nTherefore within the UWFIST framework, using the age of the \\nuniverse and the fundamental constants Ä§, G, and c (speed of light), \\nwe are able to estimate the value of cosmological constant to the same \\norder of magnitude as the observed value.\\nDiscussion \\nIn this paper, we propose a new way to derive and understand \\nstring theory, the universal wave function formulation of string theory \\n(UWFIST). From the space-time uncertainty relation, we show that \\nstring theory can be interpreted as calculating the evolution of universal wave function by the string action. We demonstrate that this new \\ndevelopment of string theory can explain the source and existence of \\ndark energy and dark matter. It can lead to the estimate of cosmological constant, possibly consistent with the experimental result using the age \\nof the universe and the fundamental constants Ä§, G, and c. \\nConclusion\\nThis work gives a new scheme for cosmology. It provides a new \\nway to understand and calculate dark energy and dark matter and to solve the cosmological constant problem from the fundamental physics theory. The detailed calculation of dark energy, dark matter, and cosmological constant is necessary to make the final conclusion about whether it can yield a plausible model for our universe. Further study and detailed calculations is needed to corroborate the result presented here. \\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work is inspired by Dr. Zhigang Sha.

Introduction\\uf020 \\nThe multiverse, also called meta-universe, parallel \\nuniverses, and alternative universes, is a hypothetical set of possible universes, including the universe in which we live [1-4]. They determine the space, time, matter, energy, physical laws, and constants that describe them. The multiverse has been hypothesized in modern theoretical physics to solve many problems in cosmology, such as the cosmological constant problem. The solution to the cosmological constant problem would calculate and explain why the vacuum energy detected in our universe is much smaller than the normal theoretical calculation in quantum field theory. \\nCurrently, the mathematical expression of the \\nmultiverse is usually obtained in an arbitrary way. The structure of the multiverse, th e nature of each universe, \\nand the relationships among the various constituent universes all depend on the specific multiverse \\n                                                           \\nCorresponding author:  Rulin Xiu, Ph.D., research field: \\ntheoretical physics.  hypothesis considered. It is ad  hoc, so to speak. This \\nmakes it impossible to experimentally test the validity of this theory [5, 6, 7].  \\nAnother concern about the hypothesis of a \\nmultiverse is how a definite observation comes about and whether it is still possible to explain and calculate measured quantities such as the masses of quarks and the electron [8]. As Nobel laureate Steve Weinberg pointed out [8], if the multiverse existed, âthe hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our Big Bang is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we liveâ. \\nIn this paper, we explore how a new development in \\nstring theory, the UWFIST (universal wave function interpretation of string theory) can provide a solution to the above issues related to the multiverse hypothesis. We will demonstrate that within UWFIST, it is possible to derive the formula expressing the multiverses from fundamental principles. We will also show how the laws of physics, the equations of D \\nDAVID  PUBLISHING  ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory \\n 2\\nmotion, and possibly the masses of fundamental \\nparticles can be derived in UWFIST. \\nString theory is a promising candidate for the grand \\nunification theory [9-12]. How to understand and derive testable re sults from string th eory has been a \\nlong debated subject. The currently accepted interpretation is that string theory is the study of the quantum dynamics of a string. The vibration of a string creates particles and interactions. When the scale of the string is set to the Planck Scale \\n(approximately 1.6 \\uf0b4 10\\n-35 meters), string theory has \\nthe potential to predict the dimensions of space-time, \\nthe particle and interaction spectrum, to unify all the forces and fundamental particles, and more. However, with all of this great potential and promise, current string theory has not yet made many testable predictions.  \\nIn our previous work [11], by combining quantum \\nphysics and general relativity, we derive a space-time uncertainty relationship, which suggests that the wave function of the universe is created from a string like action. We call this the universal wave function interpretation of string theory. UWFIST indicates the existence of long-range quantum vibrations in our universe. These long-range vibrations could be the source of dark energy and the inflaton field. From the wave function of the universe, we can calculate or estimate the vacuum energy of our universe. In Ref. \\n[11] we have demonstrated that using the age of our universe and fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant G, Planck constant Ä§, and speed \\nof light, UWFIST may yield the estimate of vacuum energy consistent with the current experimental observation. We find that these large-scale quantum vibrations can cause and explain the observed large-scale anisotropies [ 12], anomalous alignments, \\nand non-Gaussian distributions in the cosmic microwave background radiation as well as other background matter and radiation. It can also explain inflation and provide a -possible theoretical derivation for the inflaton and in flation scheme [13].  In this paper, we will briefly review the derivation \\nof the UWFIST. We will show how to derive the \\nmathematical expression of the multiverse and how to determine the observed physical laws, equations of motion, and potentially the mass and charge of fundamental particles from the UWFIST. \\n2. Derivation of UWFIST and the \\nMathematical Expression of Multiverse  \\nIn our previous work [11], we showed that when we \\ntook both the effects of quantum physics and gravity into consideration, we obtain an uncertainty relation between space measurement âÏ and time \\nmeasurement âÏ in the causal region: \\nâÏâÏ  â¥ l\\nptp              ( 1 )  \\nHere l p is the Planck length, l p = (Ä§G/c3)1/2 = 1.616 \\uf0b4 \\n10-35 meters, and t p is the Planck time, t p = (Ä§G/c5)1/2 = \\n5.39 \\uf0b4 10-44 seconds. \\nWe suggest that this relation indicates that space \\nand time are quantized and the non-commutation relation between space and time: \\n[Ï, Ï] = il\\nptp              ( 2 )  \\nUsing the quantization procedure in quantum \\nphysics [14], we propose that the space time of uncertainty Eq. (1) and non-commutation Eq. (2) indicates a string action A\\ns in the form: \\nAs = ÊdÏdÏ/lptp             ( 3 )  \\nAction A s evolves the wave function from Ï(0,0) at \\nthe space 0 and time 0 to Ï(L,T) at the space L and \\ntime T in the following way: \\nÏ(L,T) = Î£sum over all possible paths \\nexp(iÊ0TdÏÊ0LdÏ/lptp)Ï(0,0)  (4) \\nThe Eq. (4) is the universal wave function \\ninterpretation of  string theory. \\nUWFIST deviates from the usual interpretation of \\nstring theory in two ways. First, the world-sheet space Ï and time Ï integration of the Eq. (3) is over the \\ncausal region i.e. \\nA\\ns = Ê0TdÏÊ0LdÏ/lp2          ( 5 )  \\nHere T and L are the age and length of the causal \\nhorizon. They relate to the age and length of the ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory \\n 3\\nhorizon of our universe. In the normal interpretation \\nof string theory, Ï is the string coordinate. L is taken \\nto be the length of the string. It is set to be Planck length l\\np. In the Eq. (4), T and L are variables. They \\nchange as universe evolves or as space and time pass by. The second difference between the usual string theory and UWFIST is that the universal wave function Î¨(L, T) is introduced. Here Î¨(0, 0) and Î¨(L, \\nT) represent the universal wave function at the initial space and time and at the space L and time T.  \\nWe propose that the universal wave function could \\nbe the wave function of our universe. If we extend the string action to the cases of superstring and heterotic string with background fields [9, 10], the universal wave function Î¨ can include all fundamental particles, \\nall gauge interactions, gravity, and more. It also includes the large structures of our universe up to the scale of the horizon. In other words, UWFIST could be the wave function of our universe.  \\nThe wave function of our universe as derived in Eq. \\n(4) shows the different possible universes. It is the mathematic expression of multiverse. UWFIST yields natural prediction, derivation, and mathematic formula of multiverse.  \\nAccording to quantum physics, our observed \\nuniverse is manifested by our measurement. Different measurements may yield di fferent results. In the \\nfollowing, we will show that the Weyl invariance, generalized scale invariance may lead to the fixed universal constants and laws of physics, such as equations of motion and specific masses of fundamental particles. It can explain how the laws of physics and universal constants such as masses of quarks and the electron can come about in the world of the multiverse. \\n3. The Universe Is a Projection from a \\nHologram \\nIn string theory, there ar e two sets of space-time: \\nthe two-dimensional world-sheet ( Ï, Ï) and the \\nobserved space-time XÎ¼(Ï, Ï). The observed space-time XÎ¼(Ï, Ï) is a projection from the world \\nsheet to possibly a higher dimensional space-time. In \\nterms of XÎ¼(\\uf073, \\uf074), the action A s in Eq. (3) becomes: \\nAs = (1/l ptp)ÊdÏdÏg1/2gabâaXÎ¼âbXÎ¼     ( 6 )  \\nHere gÎ±Î² is the metric tensor on the world-sheet and \\ng = -detgÎ±Î². As shown in string theory [7, 8], the \\ngeneral form of Eq. (6) in the presence of a massless background field is in the form: \\nA\\ns = [i\\uf061Ê0Td\\uf074Ê0Ld\\uf073g1/2(gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ \\n+ ÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + 1/4\\uf061Î¦R)]      (7) \\nHere GÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), BÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), Î¦(\\uf074, \\uf073) are metric tensor, \\nanti-symmetric tensor, and scalar background fields \\non the observed space. And R is the scalar curvature \\nrelated to gÎ±Î². The universal wave function in the \\npresence of the background fields is: \\nÎ¨(L, T, GÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T)) = \\n\\uf0f2DXÎ¼DgÎ¼Î½DBÎ¼Î½DÎ¦ exp[i\\uf061Ê0Td\\uf074Ê0Ld\\uf073 \\ng1/2(gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + ÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½+ 1/4\\uf061Î¦R)] (8) \\nWe can extend Î¨(XÎ¼(L, T), GÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), \\nÎ¦(L, T)) to include other massive vibrations. We can \\nalso extend the above string action to the cases of superstring and heterotic string to include all fundamental particles; all gauge interactions, gravity, and more. This universal wave function tells us the probability for our universe to be at space-time (L, T) and background fields G\\nÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T). \\nWe can do a Fourier transformation to transform the wave function Î¨(L, T), G\\nÎ¼Î½(L, T, BÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T)) \\ninto the vibrational space expressed by the various vibrations ( Ï\\nÎ¼, ÎºÎ¼Î½,â¦). The wave function Î¨(ÏÎ¼(L, T), \\nÎºÎ¼Î½(L, T),â¦) expresses what kind of vibrations exist in \\nour universe and how much they exist at proper time T and horizon length L.  \\nThe proper space Ï and time Ï form the world-sheet. \\nThe world-sheet has the Weyl symmetry, the local rescaling invariance of the world-sheet metric. The Eq. (7) is invariant under the local rescaling of the world-sheet metric: \\ngâ\\nÎ±Î²(Ï, Ï) = exp(2Ï(Ï, Ï))gÎ±Î²(Ï, Ï), \\nXâÎ¼(Ï, Ï) = XÎ¼(Ï, Ï), \\nGâÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073) = GÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory \\n 4\\nBâÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073) = BÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), \\nÎ¦â(\\uf074, \\uf073) = Î¦(\\uf074, \\uf073), \\nfor an arbitrary Ï(Ï, Ï). \\nThe Weyl invariance of the world-sheet indicates \\nthat if we expand, contract, or rotate the world-sheet, the world-sheet will look the same. In other words, the world-sheet is a hologram. Our observed space-time \\nX\\nÎ¼(\\uf074, \\uf073), particles, gauge and gravity interactions are \\nthe projection from this hologram. In other words, the \\nobserved universe is a projection from the world-sheet hologram. \\n4. Derivation of the Laws of Physics and \\nEquations of Motion \\nThe fact that our observed space-time is a \\nprojection from a hologram has great consequences. One of the results is the classical equation of motion regarding the background field G\\nÎ¼Î½, BÎ¼Î½, Î¦, and more \\nexpanded as the functions of XÎ¼ [1, 2]. The detailed \\nderivation is presented in Refs. [1, 2]. We will just summarize this derivation. In a nutshell, it is obtained by calculating the higher or der corrections to the Eq. \\n(7). The Weyl invariance is automatically preserved at the first order. However, the higher order corrections threaten to violate it. For example, at the second order, the following corrections occur: \\nÎ²\\nG\\nÎ¼Î½ = Î±RÎ¼Î½ + 2Î±\\u05cfÎ¼\\u05cfÎ½Î¦ + Î±/4HÎ¼Î»ÏHÎ½Î»Ï+ O(Î±2)  (9) \\nÎ²B\\nÎ¼Î½ = -Î±/4\\u05cfÏHÎ¼Î»Ï+ Î±\\u05cfÏÎ¦HÏÎ¼Î½+ O(Î±2)   (10) \\nÎ²Î¦ = (D-26)/4 - Î±/2\\u05cf2Î¦ + Î±\\u05cfÏÎ¦\\u05cfÏÎ¦ - \\nÎ±/24HÎ¼Î½Î»HÎ¼Î½Î»+ O(Î±2)           ( 1 1 )  \\nThe preservation of Weyl invariance at the higher \\norders requires that: \\nÎ²G\\nÎ¼Î½ = Î²B\\nÎ¼Î½ = Î²Î¦ = 0. \\nNotice that Î²G\\nÎ¼Î½ = 0 leads to the generalized \\nEinsteinâs equation with the source terms from the anti-symmetric tensor and dilaton. The equation Î²\\nB\\nÎ¼Î½ = \\n0 is the antisymmetric generalization of Maxwell equation. We can see that by requiring Weyl invariance, we are able to derive the equation of motion for the background fields G\\nÎ¼Î½, BÎ¼Î½, and Î¦. In \\nother words, the classical equations of motion including Einsteinâs general relativity, \\nelectromagnetism, and other gauge interactions, \\nfundamental particles, and other background fields and matter come from the fact that our universe is a projection from a hologram. This can explain how fundamental laws such as Einsteinâs general relativity, electromagnetism, and other gauge interaction, fundamental particles, and other background fields and matter come about in the multiverse.  \\n5. Derivation of the Masses of Fundamental \\nParticles from UWFIST \\nParticle physics studies the fundamental particles \\nthat make up matter in the physical realm. Electrons, muons, quarks, and photons are some of these elementary particles. One of the fascinating phenomena discovered in particle physics is that particles also have âgenerationsâ. Physicists have discovered three generations of elementary particles so far. The different generations have similar sets of elementary particles, except that th eir masses are different.  \\nThe Higgs boson is the current scheme to give mass \\nto elementary particles in the standard model. We suggest that by requiring the Weyl invariance at higher order, we may obtain further restrictions or equations to gravity, electromagnetism, and other gauge interaction, fundamental particles, and other background fields and forms of matter. This may lead to the determination of the mass of some particles. The masses are the possibl e solutions to these \\nequations. This may provide a way for us to derive the masses of fundamental particles, and may possibly explain the existence of generations of elementary particles. \\n6. Conclusion \\nIn this paper, we show that the multiverse is a \\nnatural result of UWFIST. UWFIST not only supports the multiverse hypothesis, it also provides the scheme to mathematically derive the expression of the multiverse from fundamental principles by providing ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Derivation of Multiverse from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory \\n 5\\na way to calculate the wave function of our universe. \\nThe wave function of our universe exposes \\nmathematically countless possible universes existing simultaneously. Our universe actually contains many possibilities. It exists simultaneously in all these possibilities. In this sense, we exist in multiple universes.  \\nIn the myriad of the multiverse, our world changes \\nconstantly and quickly depending on our observations and measurements. However,  certain things do not \\nchange due to the fact that our universe is a projection \\nfrom a hologram. The unchanging quantities make up the laws and specific matter we observe. The existence of classical equatio ns as well as definite \\nmasses and possibly other properties are due to the fact that our universe is a projection from a hologram. It has already been shown in string theory that Weyl invariance in string theory leads to the observed laws of physics and the equations of motion. We suggest that it may also determine the specific masses of the observed fundamental particles.  \\nWe suggest one should calculate higher order \\ncorrections of Weyl invariance to determine the masses of the observed fundamental particles. We will present our work on this in the future.  \\nReferences \\n[1] Kragh, H. 2009. âContemporary History of Cosmology \\nand the Controversy over the Multiverse.â Annals of \\nScience  66 (4): 529-51. \\n[2] Steinhardt, Paul. 2014. âBig Bang Blunder Bursts the \\nMultiverse Bubble.â Nature  510: 9. \\n[3] Max Tegmark, and Alexander Vilenkin. 2011. âThe Case \\nfor Parallel Universes.â Retrieved 12 October 2013.

This work confirms and derives from the fundamental principle Xiao Gang \\nWenâs result that string-net condensation is a way to generate elementary particles and unify light and electrons. In our previous work, we proposed the law of creation. We derived string theory, M theory, and the wave function of our universe from this fundamental law. We show that one can explain the expanding universe, dark matter, dark energy, the large structure of the universe, inflation, and the laws of physics related to gravity, weak and strong forces, and electromagnetism. In this paper, we show how to derive the existence of elementary particles and how to explain the wave-particle duality of elementary particles from the law of creation. We show that a string-like action creates the vibrational field of our universe. Due to the PoincarÃ© invariance in the string-like action, elementary particles emerge from the vibrational field of our universe. As the different representations of PoincarÃ© symmetry, elementary particles have specific still mass and spin. This explains the wave-particle duality of elementary particles.\\nKeywords:  Universal Wave function Interpretation of String theory, Elementary particles, \\nGrand unification theory, String theory, M theory, Law of creation.\\nIntroduction\\nElementary particles are the most basic constituents of matter discovered since the \\n1930s [1]. They are composed of particles with integer spin, elementary bosons and \\nparticles with half-integer spin, elementary fermions. Currently discovered elementary fermions include electrons, muons, and quarks. Elementary bosons consist of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons. Gauge bosons, such as photons, W and Z bosons, and gluons, mediate electromagnetic, weak and strong interaction. The Higgs boson has been discovered to be responsible for the intrinsic mass of particles. \\nAll of the elementary particles and fundamental forces, except for gravity, are \\ncurrently described by the standard model in particle physics [1]. The standard model is considered the most experimentally successful theory because it gives a consistent description of the elementary particles discovered to date.\\nThere are major reasons to go beyond the standard model. First, one would like not \\nonly a description but also to know where the elementary particles come from. Second, one would prefer to have a unified theory for all fundamental particles and forces including gravity. Third, one wants to unify Einsteinâs relativity theory with quantum physics based on one mathematically consistent formulation derived from one fundamental principle.

The grand unification theory, also called the theory \\nof everything or grand unified theory, is the attempt to use one mathematical formula to explain all the fundamental forces and matter discovered so far and to integrate quantum physics with general relativity. String theory is a promising candidate for the grand unification theory. String theory incorporates gravity and other gauge forces in one mathematically consistent formulation [2,3]. It also has the potential to generate all of the elementary particles and all interactions including gravity, and thus to unify all the forces and fundamental particles. However, with all of this great promise, string theory has not yet made many testable predictions. Something is still missing in current string theory. \\nThere have been other attempts to unify all matter and \\nforces. In recent years, Xiao Gang Wen and his colleagues proposed and demonstrated [4-7] that light, electrons, and other fermions may come from the qubits that form a string-net condensed state. Light is basically collective motions of strings, and fermions are ends of open strings in the string-net condensed state. However, it is unknown how to explain this interesting result from a fundamental principle or law. \\nIn this paper, we derive the existence of elementary \\nparticles from the law of creation. This work confirms Xiao Gang Wenâs result and deduces it from the fundamental law of creation. \\nIn our previous work, we proposed the law of creation [8] \\nand showed that it reveals the exact process for how all existence is created through the process âit from bitâ as proposed by John Wheeler. We demonstrate that it could be the fundamental principle leading to the grand unification theory. This law states that everything is created from emptiness through yin yang interaction. Yin and yang are the two basic elements that make up everything. Yin and yang are opposite, relative, co-created, inseparable, and co-dependent. We show that two fundamental yin yang pairs, space and time yin yang pair and inclusion and exclusion yin yang pair, create our universe. From this insight, one can derive string theory, superstring or M theory, and the Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory (UWFIST). Our work \\ndemonstrates that UWFIST has the potential to derive dark \\nmatter, dark energy, inflation, and the large structure of our universe consistent with observation [9-12]. \\nIn another work [13], we show that UWFIST also indicates \\nthat the equations of motion regarding electromagnetic force and gravity and other laws of physics are the result of Weyl invariance. In this way, quantum physics and general relativity is integrated in one unified mathematical framework.\\nIn this paper, we explore how the elementary particles \\ncome about in UWFIST. First, we will review our previous work. Then we will show that the PoincarÃ© Invariance, inherent in the action that creates our universe, suggests the existence of elementary particles. Elementary particles are simply a PoincarÃ© invariant identity emerging from the 2-dimensional world sheet, corresponding to the âstring netâ mentioned in Xiao Gang Wenâs work. This explains why one can find elementary particles no matter where one places a detector and why particles can be classified by mass and spin. This also explains the discovery by Xiao Gang Wen and his colleagues that elementary particles can come from string-net condensation in vacuum. Finally, we will explore the possible consequences of this work.\\nReview of the Law of Creation and \\nDerivation of UWFIST\\nIn our paper [8], we proposed the law of creation, which \\nstates that everything is created from emptiness through yin \\nyang interaction. Yin and yang are two basic elements that make up everything. They are opposite, relative, co-created, inseparable, and co-dependent. The two elements in one bit of information is a yin yang pair. The law of creation basically tells us how information creates everything. It specifically describes the process of âit from bitâ proposed by John Wheeler [14-16]. \\nThe universe we observe is determined by our measurement. \\nBased on the law of creation, we propose that all human measurements are made of two basic yin yang pairs: space and time measurement and inclusion and exclusion measurement. Time is related to the measurement of movement and space relates to the measurement of non-movement. Space and time is a yin yang pair. The interaction of these two yin yang pairs, the space and time yin yang pair and the exclusion and inclusion yin yang pair, creates our universe. \\nThe simplest action created by the interaction of the \\nspace-time yin yang pair is:\\nA\\n1=Î±â«âÏâÏ\\t (1)\\nHere\\twe\\tuse\\tthe\\tsymbol\\tÏ\\tto\\trepresent\\tspace\\tand\\tthe\\t\\nsymbol\\tÏ\\tto\\trepresent\\ttime.\\tWe\\tuse\\tâÏ\\tand\\tâÏ\\tto\\trepresent\\t\\nthe\\tspace\\tand\\ttime\\tduration\\tto\\tbe\\tmeasured.\\tThe\\tsymbol\\tâ«\\t\\nrepresents the summation over space and time from the \\nbeginning\\tÏ=0\\tand\\tÏ=0\\ttill\\tnow\\tÏ=T\\tand\\tÏ=L.\\tHere\\tT\\tis\\tthe\\t\\nage of our universe and L is the horizon of our universe.

In Quantum physics, everything is mathematically represented by a wave function. One can calculate the wave function of our universe using Feynmanâs path integral formulation of quantum physics [17]. According to this method, the wave function created by the action A\\n2 is of the form:\\nÎ¨=âsum over all possible statesCexp(iÎ±A2) (3)\\nHere C is a constant. The\\tsymbol\\tâ\\tis\\tto\\tsum\\tover\\tall\\t\\npossible paths and states. The equation (3) is the universal wave function formulation of string theory. We call this the universal wave function interpretation of string theory. \\nIn our previous work, we show [9-13] that UWFIST has the \\npotential to predict dark matter, dark energy, and inflation. It can also explain the observed large-scale anisotropies, non-Gaussian distributions, and anomalous alignments of the quadrupole and octupole modes in the microwave background. \\nThe wave function for our universe derived in UWFIST \\nsuggests that our universe consists of many possibilities and states. In this sense, it is a multiverse. UWFIST gives the mathematical formula of the multiverse. The multiverse nature of our universe suggests that when we make a measurement, there may not be a definite result. If this is the case, how can we explain the equations of motion discovered so far in nature, such as gravity, and electromagnetism? In our paper [13], we demonstrate that the observed laws of nature come about due to the Weyl symmetry inherent in the actions A1 and A2. Requiring the invariance of local Weyl symmetry, one can derive the equations of motion discovered in nature. In this way, quantum physics and classical physics including Einsteinâs relativity theory come together in formula (3). In this way, quantum physics and general relativity are unified in the one mathematical formula (3). \\nThe Emergence of Elementary Particles \\nas the Invariance of PoincarÃ© Symmetry\\nThe discovery of elementary particles suggests that one \\nfinds elementary particles no matter where one puts the \\ndetector. The mass and spin of an elementary particle remains unchanged no matter where you detect it and who detects it.\\nIf our universe is a multiverse and the phenomena we \\nobserve depends on the measurement, how can we explain the existence of elementary particles? We propose that the appearance of elementary particles is due to PoincarÃ© symmetry intrinsic in the action (1) and (2) that creates our universe.\\nIn string theory, there are two sets of space-time: the \\n2-dimensional\\t world-sheet\\t (Ï,\\tÏ,\\tÎ¸\\nÏ,\\tÎ¸Ï) and the observed \\nspace-time [XÎ¼(Ï,\\tÏ),\\tÏÎ¼(Ï,\\tÏ)].\\tThe\\tobserved\\tspace-time\\tXÎ¼(Ï,\\t\\nÏ)\\tand\\tfermions\\t ÏÎ¼(Ï,\\tÏ)\\tare\\ta\\tprojection\\tfrom\\tthe\\tworld\\tsheet\\t\\n(Ï,\\tÏ,\\tÎ¸Ï,\\tÎ¸Ï).\\tThe\\tintroduction\\t of\\tÎ¸Ï\\tand\\tÎ¸Ï brings fermions into \\nthe observed space.

Elementary particles are different representations of PoincarÃ© symmetry.\\nFrom this, one finds that the repeatable experiment of \\nfinding elementary particles with definite mass and spin no matter where and when one makes the measurement is due to the PoincarÃ© symmetry. One can therefore confirm the emergence and observation of vibrations with definite mass and spin is due to the PoincarÃ¨ invariance intrinsic to the string-like action that creates our universe (2). From this, we can conclude the existence of elementary particles and also the wave-particle duality of the elementary particles.\\nDiscussion and Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we derive the existence of elementary \\nparticles from the law of creation. We review our previous work, which shows that the interaction of space and time and inclusion and exclusion action creates our universe. We review our derivation of the wave function of the universe. We show that the wave function of our universe is created by two-dimensional string action. We demonstrate that elementary particles are the emergence from the vibrational field created by the two-dimensional string action due to PoincarÃ© invariance. Our work can explain the discovery by Xian Gang Wen and his colleagues that elementary particles emerge from string-net condensation from a fundamental principle. It also explains the wave-particle duality of elementary particles. \\nThis work provides a way to explain and derive from a \\nfundamental principle where all the elementary particles come from. In our previous work, we show that this approach, also called UWFIST, has the potential to derive dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and the large structure of our universe consistent with observation.

He suggested that what we take \\nfor reality is an explicate order which emerges from an implicate order. However, the derivation and mathematical formulation of such a theory remained unclear. In this work, we show that from the Law of Creation we can derive the existence of two kinds of space and time. One is the usual observable spacetime, described by spacetime coordinates. It corresponds to explicate order. The other is the space and time that is related to the measurement of non-movement and movement. We call this internal spacetime. Internal space and time form the two-dimensional world-sheet in string theory and they correspond to the implicate order. The Observable spacetime is the projection from Internal spacetime. We show the mathematical formula expressing the relationship between these two spacetimes. This work leads to a deeper understanding about spacetime and the discovery of a new property of observed spacetime. We find that each of the observable spacetime coordinates consists of an infinite number of vibrations and is a vibrational field. This vibrational field is made of two independent sets of vibrations, oscillating or spinning in opposite directions. The movement or change of each coordinate in observable spacetime can interact with gravity and gauge interactions and result in the creation of information, energy, and matter. \\nKeywords: Law of Creation; Observable Spacetime; Internal Spacetime; Implicate order; \\nExplicate order; Relationship between Observable Spacetime and Internal Spacetime\\nIntroduction\\nQuantum physics is the most fundamental theory of physics. Quantum physics \\nstudies what everything is made of and how it behaves at the atomic and subatomic \\nlevels [1-4]. Although quantum physics has led to the most accurate predictions to date about the nature of matter and the universe, a metaphysical foundation of quantum physics has still not been fully established. To understand the intrinsic non-deterministic and subjective nature of quantum physics as well as the non-local phenomena such as quantum entanglement existing in quantum physics, David Bohm proposed the concepts of implicate and explicate orders [5]. Bohm suggests that what we take for reality is âsurface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate orderâ. This means that the implicate order is the ground from which reality emerges.\\nTo develop a mathematic formulation for explicate and implicate order, David Bohm \\nand other physicists suggest that the implicate order is represented in the form of an \\nappropriate algebra or pregeometry [6-10]. Spacetime is part of an explicate order that ISSN: 2641-886X', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\DerivationoftheExistenceofTwoKindsofSpace.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='International Journal of Cosmology, Astronomy and Astrophysics19\\nInt J Cosmol Astron Astrophys.\\nISSN: 2641-886XVolume 1 â¢ Issue 1 â¢ 1000107is connected to an implicate order that they call pre-space. \\nThe locality and non locality observed in quantum physics all arise from an order in pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra. \\nIn our previous work, we used the Law of Creation to \\nderive string theory, M theory, and the wave function of our universe [11-17]. We show that this new progress in string theory can lead to derivation and prediction of the expanding universe, dark matter, dark energy, the large structure of the universe, the derivation of the observed physics laws about fundamental interactions, and the existence of the elementary particles. The Law of Creation states that everything is created from emptiness through yin yang interaction. Yin and yang are the two basic elements that make up everything. Yin and yang are opposite, relative, co-created, inseparable, and co-dependent. \\nIn this paper, we propose that the Law of Creation \\nindicates the existence of two types of spacetime, the internal spacetime and the observed spacetime. They correspond to the implicate order and explicate order. We derive the relationship between these two spacetimes. We find that it reveals some interesting properties about the observable spacetime. It indicates that each coordinate in observable spacetime is a vibrational field. It is made of infinite oscillators spinning in the Minkowski spacetime in two different directions. Each point in observable spacetime contains the information of the whole universe. The changes in the observable spacetime coordinates can interact with gravity and other gauge interactions and create information, energy, and matter. \\nIn the following, we will first review the Law of Creation \\nand our previous work about how the Law of Creation gives us a new deeper insight about space and time. We suggest that there exists a deeper internal space and time, which relates to our consciousness and measurement of non-movement and movement. The interaction of the internal space and internal time contributes to the action that creates \\nthe information, energy, and matter of our universe. This \\ninternal spacetime forms the two-dimension world sheet in string theory. We propose that it corresponds to the implicate order that determines our observed physical world. The observable spacetime is a projection from this implicate order. We show mathematically that the internal spacetime is a hologram. The observed spacetime, or the physical world, is a projection from this hologram. It can be of higher dimensional spacetime. \\nReview of Law of Creation and Derivation of UWFIST\\nIn our paper [11], we propose the Law of creation, which \\nstates that everything is created from the emptiness through \\nthe yin yang interaction. Yin and yang are two basic elements that make up everything. They are opposite, relative, co-created, inseparable, and co-dependent. For instance, change and unchanged are a yin yang pair.In quantum physics, all phenomena are determined by \\nmeasurement. Like everything else, measurement is made of yin yang elements. We suggest [11] at a deeper level, space is related to the consciousness and measurement of unchangeness or non-movement and time is related to the consciousness and measurement of changeness or movement. This space and time is a yin yang pair. Letâs call it internal spacetime. All human measurement and consciousness are based on two yin yang pairs. One is the internal space and time yin yang pair. The other is the inclusion and exclusion yin yang pair. The interaction of these two yin yang pairs: space and time yin yang pair and exclusion and inclusion yin yang pair, creates our universe.\\nThe simplest action created by the interaction of the \\nspace-time yin yang pair is:\\nA1=Î±â«âÏâ Ï (1)\\nHere we use the symbol Ï to represent space and the \\nsymbol Ï to represent time. We use âÏ and âÏ to represent the space and time duration to be measured. The symbol â« represents the summation over space and time from the beginning Ï=0 and Ï=0 till now Ï=T and Ï=L. Here T is the age of our universe and L is the horizon of our universe. And Î± is a constant. In our work [12], we show that:\\nÎ±=1/(lptp)\\nHere tp is the Planck time. It is of the magnitude of 5.4Ã10-\\n44 second. Here lp is the Planck length. It is of the magnitude \\nof 1.6Ã10-35 meter. \\nThe simplest action created by the space and time yin \\nyang pair and the exclusion and inclusion yin yang pair is:\\nA2=Î±â«âÏâÏâ Î¸ÏâÎ¸Ï (2)\\nHere we use Î¸Ïand Î¸Ï to represent the fermion partner of \\nspace and time coordinates Ï and Ï. The Î¸Ï and Î¸Ï can only take \\non the value 0 or 1 because they are repulsive and refuse to stay at the same place with another element. The symbol â« represents the summation over space Ï and time Ï and Î¸\\nÏ and Î¸Ï.\\nOne can easily see that the actions (1) and (2) are the \\nactions for string theory and superstring theory or M theory [18]. In this way, one derives string theory and M-theory or superstring theory from the Law of Creation. \\nTo calculate what is inside our universe, we propose to \\ncalculate the wave function created by the action (2) by summing over the range of the horizon of our observation. In Quantum physics, everything is mathematically represented by wave function. As we suggested in our previous work [19], a wave function describes the information, energy, and matter contained in an object. One can calculate the wave function of our universe using Feynmanâs path integral formulation of quantum physics [20]. According to this method, the wave function created by the action A\\n2 is in the form:\\nÎ¨=âsum over all possible states C exp(iÎ±A2) (3)\\nwhere C is a constant . The symbol â is the summation \\nover all possible paths and states. Equation (3) is the universal wave function formulation of string theory. We call this the universal wave function interpretation of string theory (UWFIST).

This internal space and \\ntime are related to the measurement of changing or unchanging. It forms the world sheet in string theory. \\nIn our previous work, we show that the interaction of this \\nspace and time yin yang pair and the interaction of inclusive and exclusive yin yang pair create all the information, energy, and matter of our universe, including dark matter, dark energy, inflation, large structure of our universe, fundamental laws of physics such as gravity, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, and elementary particles [11-17]. \\nInternal spacetime is represented by the world sheet \\nspace-time (Ï,Ï). In addition to the internal space and time, there is the observable space-time, normally related to and expressed by the space-time coordinate X\\nÎ¼. In string theory, \\nthey are a projection from the internal spacetime and expressed as X\\nÎ¼(Ï,Ï).XÎ¼(Ï,Ï) defines a projection from the \\ninternal spacetime. We can see that the world sheet spacetime (Ï,Ï) corresponds to the implicate world and the observable spacetime X\\nÎ¼(Ï,Ï)belongs to the explicate order. \\nMore accurately, the observable space-time XÎ¼(Ï, Ï) and \\nfermions ÏÎ¼(Ï, Ï) relating to elementary particles are a \\nprojection from the world sheet (Ï, Ï, Î¸Ï, Î¸Ï). The two-\\ndimensional super world-sheet (Ï, Ï, Î¸Ï, Î¸Ï) is projected to the \\nobservable spacetime and particles [XÎ¼(Ï, Ï), ÏÎ¼(Ï, Ï)]. The \\nobservable spacetime and particles [XÎ¼(Ï, Ï), ÏÎ¼(Ï, Ï)]\\ncorrespond to explicate order. In terms of [XÎ¼(Ï, Ï), ÏÎ¼(Ï, Ï)] \\nand integrating over Î¸Ï and Î¸Ï, the action A2becomes [18]:\\nA2 = (1/lptp)â«âÏâÏâ Î¸ÏâÎ¸Ïg1/2gab[(GÎ¼v + BÎ¼v) âaXÎ¼âbXv+ \\nGÎ¼Î½(X)(ÏÎ¼DÏÎ½+ Ï+Î¼DÏ+Î½) + Â½ RÎ¼Î½ÏÏ(X)ÏÎ¼ÏÎ½Ï+ÏÏ+Ï] (4)\\nHere gÎ±Î² is the metric tensor on the world-sheet and g = \\n- det gab; GÎ¼v and BÎ¼v are metric tensors on the observed space. \\nThe gravity and gauge interactions can be represented by GÎ¼v \\nand BÎ¼v. \\nThe world-sheet has Weyl symmetry, the local rescaling \\ninvariance of the world-sheet metric. The action (4) is invariant under the local rescaling of the world-sheet metric:\\ngÂ´\\nÎ±Î²(Ï, Ï)=exp(2Ï(Ï, Ï))gÎ±Î²(Ï, Ï) \\nXÂ´Î¼(Ï, Ï)=XÎ¼(Ï, Ï)\\nGâÎ¼Î½(Ï, Ï) = GÎ¼Î½(Ï, Ï)\\nBâÎ¼Î½(Ï, Ï) = BÎ¼Î½(Ï, Ï)\\nÏÎ¼â(Ï, Ï) = ÏÎ¼(Ï, Ï)\\nfor arbitrary Ï(Ï, Ï) .\\nThe Weyl invariance of the world-sheet indicates that if \\nwe expand or contract or rotate internal spacetime, the implicate order, the action, and therefore all phenomena, will remain the same. In other words, the internal spacetime is a hologram. The observable space-time X\\nÎ¼(Ï,Ï), elementary \\nparticles, gauge and gravity interactions, and everything such as dark matter and dark energy in the observable world are projections from this hologram. Derivation of the Relationship between \\nthe Observable Spacetime and Internal Spacetime and its Implications\\nTo find the relationship between the internal spacetime \\n(Ï,Ï), the implicate order, and the observable spacetime XÎ¼(Ï, \\nÏ),the explicate order, one can obtain the solution for the action (2) [18]. Such a solution is in the form of:\\nX\\ni(Ï, Ï) = xi+ piÏ/p + i (Ã¡'\\n2)1/2\\nexp[-2Ï inÏ + cÏ)/L]+\\n  \\ni\\nnexp[2Ï-cÏ)/L]}.  (5)\\nHere xi and pi are center of mass coordinates and momentum. \\nai\\nn and ai\\nn are two independent sets of oscillators, corresponding \\nto left-moving and right-moving waves in internal spacetime. This equation tells us the relationship between observed spacetime and the internal spacetime, which is the relationship between the explicate order and implicate order. \\nEquation (5) is expressed in Euclidean spacetime. To \\nexpress the relation in Minkowski spacetime (Ï, Ï\\n0), we \\nintroduce Ï0= i cÏ (here i is the imaginary number). The \\nrelationship (5) becomes:\\nXi(Ï, Ï) = xi+ piÏ /p + i (Ã¡'\\n2)1/2 \\nexp[-2Ï in(Ï - iÏ0)/L]+\\nexp[2Ï + iÏ0)/L]}.  (6)\\nWe can see in Minkowski spacetime, the observed \\nspacetime is made of two independent sets of oscillators spinning in opposite directions in the internal spacetime.\\nFrom equation (6), we can see that each coordinate in \\nobservable spacetime is a vibrational field. It is made of infinite vibrations. The vibrational field associated with each coordinate is made of two sets of independent âspinorsâ and oscillators spinning in two different directions in internal spacetime. From equation (4), we can see that the changes in the observable spacetime coordinates can interact with gravity and other gauge interactions and change the wave function, and thus create information, energy, and matter. \\nConclusion\\nIn this work, from the Law of Creation we derive the \\nexistence of two different kinds of spacetime. One is internal spacetime related to the measurement of non-movement and movement. It corresponds to the implicate order. The other is the observable spacetime expressed by the usual spacetime coordinates. It corresponds to the explicate order. We show that observable spacetime is a projection from internal spacetime. We present the mathematical relationship between observable spacetime and internal spacetime, which is part of the relationship between explicate order and implicate order. From this relationship, we find that each observable spacetime location consists of an infinite number of vibrations and is a vibrational field. This vibrational field is made of two independent sets of vibrations, corresponding to two opposite oscillating or spinning directions. The movement or change of each coordinate in observable spacetime can interact with gravity and gauge interactions and result in the creation of information, energy, and matter. \", metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\DerivationoftheExistenceofTwoKindsofSpace.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='International Journal of Cosmology, Astronomy and Astrophysics21\\nInt J Cosmol Astron Astrophys.\\nISSN: 2641-886XVolume 1 â¢ Issue 1 â¢ 1000107This research confirms David Bohmâs theory about implicate \\norder and explicate order.

String theory is one of the promising candidates for the gr and unification theory. Grand unifi cation theory is to use one \\nmathematic formula to describe everything. In this work, we st udy the inflation scheme in a new development in string theory, \\nUWFIST (universal wave function interpretation of string theory). We show th at from UWFIST we can de rive from the fundamental \\ntheory that the long-range vibration is the possible candidate of inflation. We estima te the vacuum energy created by the long- range \\nvibration and show that it can indeed drive the inflation.  Key words: Inflation, string theory, universal wave function interpretation of string theory, grand unification theory.  \\n \\n1. Introduction\\uf020 \\nIn physical cosmology, inflation is a theory of \\nexponential expansion of space in the early universe. Inflation theory proposes a rapid exponential expansion of the early universe  by a factor of at least \\n10\\n78 in volume, driven by a negative-pressure vacuum \\nenergy density [1, 2] . The inflationary epoch lasted \\nfrom 10-36 seconds to 10-33 and 10-32 seconds after the \\nbig bang. Following the inflationary period, the universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate [1, 2]. \\nDeveloped in the early 1980s, inflation is so far the \\nmostly accepted way to solve the fine-tuning problems with the initial conditions of the universe. Inflation hypothesis can show why our universe appears flat, homogeneous, and isotropic. It can account for the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos and why no magnetic monopoles have been detected.  \\nThe hypothetical particle or field thought to be \\nresponsible for inflation is called inflation. However, \\n                                                           \\nCorresponding author:  Rulin Xiu, Ph.D., research field: \\ntheoretical physics.  the detailed particle physics mechanism responsible \\nfor inflation or inflation remains unknown. Furthermore, the abundance of âbad inflationâ in the quantum theory and the realization that inflation is eternal has been challenging the real predictive power of inflation theory [3-6].  \\nIn this work we will derive the possible inflation \\nand the energy created by the inflation for the inflation from a new development in string theory, the UWFIST (universal wave function interpretation of string theory).  \\nString theory is a promising candidate for the grand \\nunification theory [7, 8]. How to understand and \\nderive testable re sults from string th eory has been a \\nlong debated subject. The currently accepted interpretation is that string theory studies the quantum dynamics of a string. The vibration of string creates particles and interactions. The scale of the string is set \\nto be Planck Scale (approximately 1.6 \\uf0b4 10\\n-35 meters). \\nString theory has the potential to predict the \\ndimension of space-time, the particle and interaction spectrum, to unify all the forces and fundamental particles, and more. However, with all these great D \\nDAVID  PUBLISHING  ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory 34\\npotentials and promises, current string theory has not \\nyet made many testable predictions.  \\nIn our previous work [9, 10] by combining quantum \\nphysics and general relativity, we derive a space-time uncertainty relationship, which suggests that the wave function of universe and everything is created from a string like action. We call this the UWFIST. UWFIST indicates the existence of long-range quantum vibrations in our universe. These long-range vibrations could be the source of dark energy. From \\nthe wave function of universe, we can calculate or estimate the vacuum energy of our universe. In Ref. [9] \\nwe have demonstrated that using the age of our universe and fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant G, Planck constant Ä§, and speed \\nof light, UWFIST may yield the estimate of vacuum energy consistent with the current experimental observation. We find Ref. [10] that these large-scale quantum vibrations can cause and explain the observed large-scale anisotropies, anomalous \\nalignments, and non-Gaussian distributions in the cosmic microwave background radiation as well as in other background matter and radiation.  \\nIn this paper, we will briefly review the derivation \\nof the UWFIST. We will show that there exist the long-range vibrations in UWFIST. We will show that these long-range vibrational fields can generate the vacuum energy density, which can drive the inflation in the early age of the universe. They are the possible candidates for inflation.  \\n2. A New Way to Derive and Interpret \\nString Theory \\nIn our previous work, we show that when we take \\nboth the effect of quantum physics and gravity into consideration, we obtain an uncertainty relation between space measurement âÏ and time \\nmeasurement âÏ in causal region: \\nâÏâÏ  â¥ l\\nptp           ( 1 )  \\nHere l p is the Planck length, l p = (Ä§G/c3)1/2 = 1.616 \\n\\uf0b4 10-35 meter. And t p is the Planck time, t p = (Ä§G/c5)1/2 = 5.39 \\uf0b4 10-44 second. \\nWe suggest that this relation indicates that space \\nand time are quantized and the non-commutation relation between space and time:  \\n[Ï, Ï] = il\\nptp            ( 2 )  \\nUsing the quantization procedure in quantum \\nphysics [11], we propose that the space time uncertainty relation (1) and non-commutation relation (2) indicates a st ring action A\\ns in the form: \\nAs = ÊdÏdÏ/lptp           ( 3 )  \\nAction A s evolves the wave function from Ï(0,0) at \\nthe space 0 and time 0 to Ï(L,T) at the space L and \\ntime T in the following way: \\nÏ(L, T) = Î£sum over all possible paths exp(iÊ0TdÏÊ0LdÏ/lptp) \\nÏ(0,0)    (4) \\nThe Eq. (4) is the UWFIST.  \\nUWFIST deviates from the usual interpretation of \\nstring theory in two ways. Firstly, the world-sheet space Ï and time Ï integration of the Eq. (3) is over \\nthe causal region i.e. \\nA\\ns = Ê0TdÏÊ0LdÏ/lp2 \\nHere T and L are the age and length of the causal \\nhorizon. They relate to the age and length of the horizon of our universe. In the normal interpretation of string theory, Ï is the string coordinate. L is taken \\nto be the length of the string. It is set to be Planck length l\\np. In Eq. (4), T and L are variables. They \\nchange as universe evolves or as space and time pass by. The second difference between the usual string theory and UWFIST is that the universal wave function Î¨(L, T) are introduced. Here Î¨(0, 0) and Î¨(L, \\nT) represents the universal wave function at the initial space and time and at the space L and time T. We propose that the universal wave function could be the wave function of our universe. This is because if we extend the string action to the cases of superstring and heterotic string with background fields, the universal wave function Î¨ can include all fundamental particles, \\nall gauge interactions, gravity, and more. It also includes the large structures of our universe up to the scale of horizon. In other words, UWFIST could be ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory 35\\nthe wave function of our universe. Except for these \\ntwo major conceptual differences, the usual string \\ntheory calculation can still be applied in UWFIST.  \\nIn the string theory, there are two sets of space-time: \\nthe 2-dimensional world-sheet ( Ï, Ï) and the observed \\nspace-time XÎ¼ (Ï, Ï). The observed space-time XÎ¼ (Ï, Ï) \\nis a projection from the world sheet to possibly a \\nhigher dimensional space-time. In terms of XÎ¼(\\uf073, \\uf074), \\nthe action As in Eq. (3) becomes: \\nAs = (1/l ptp)ÊdÏdÏg1/2gabâaXÎ¼âbXÎ¼    ( 5 )  \\nHere gÎ±Î² is the metric tensor on the world-sheet and \\ng = -det gÎ±Î². As shown in string theory [7, 8], the \\ngeneral form of Eq. (5) in the presence of massless background field is in the form: \\nA\\ns = [i\\uf061Ê0Td\\uf074Ê0Ld\\uf073 g1/2(gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + \\nÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + 1/4\\uf061Î¦R)]        ( 6 )  \\nHere GÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), BÎ¼Î½(\\uf074, \\uf073), Î¦(\\uf074, \\uf073) are metric tensor, \\nanti-symmetric tensor, and scalar background fields \\non the observed space. And R is the scalar curvature \\nrelated to gÎ±Î². The universal wave function in the \\npresence of background fields is: \\nÎ¨(XÎ¼(L, T), GÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T)) = \\n\\uf0f2DXÎ¼DgÎ¼Î½DBÎ¼Î½DÎ¦exp[i\\uf061Ê0Td\\uf074Ê0Ld\\uf073 \\ng1/2(gÎ±Î²GÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + ÎµÎ±Î²BÎ¼Î½âÎ±XÎ¼âÎ²XÎ½ + 1/4\\uf061Î¦R)] (7) \\nWe can extend Î¨(XÎ¼(L, T), GÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), \\nÎ¦(L, T)) to include other massive vibrations. We can \\nalso extend the above string action to the cases of \\nsuperstring and heterotic string to include all \\nfundamental particles, all gauge interactions, gravity, \\nand more. This universal wave function tells us the \\nprobability for our universe to be at space-time coordinate X\\nÎ¼(L, T) and background fields GÎ¼Î½(L, T), \\nBÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T). We can do a Fourier \\ntransformation to transform the wave function Î¨(XÎ¼(L, \\nT), GÎ¼Î½(L, T), BÎ¼Î½(L, T), Î¦(L, T)) to be expressed in \\nthe vibrational space expressed by the various vibrations ( Ï\\nÎ¼, ÎºÎ¼Î½,â¦). The wave function Î¨(ÏÎ¼(L, T), \\nÎºÎ¼Î½(L, T),â¦) expresses what kind of vibrations in our \\nuniverse and how much they exist at proper time T \\nand horizon length L in our universe.  3. Inflation and the Energy Driving Inflation \\nA natural indication and consequence of UWFIST \\nis the existence of long-range vibrations. The \\nspace-time coordinate XÎ¼(\\uf074, \\uf073) is composed of \\nvibrations in the form exp[i Ïn(\\uf073+c\\uf074)/L] and \\nexp[iÏn(\\uf073-c\\uf074)/L]. Here n is an integer. Unlike the \\nnormal string theory, in which L is the Planck length, \\nnow L is causal horizon distance. The largest wavelength is on the order of the length of the causal horizon. These vibrations are very fine. They are very dark in the sense that it is very difficult to detect them. In fact, to detect the vibration with the wavelength L, it takes the time L/c. If L is the horizon distance, this means that it takes the time of the age of the visible universe or a detector as large as the whole visible universe to detect these vibrations.  \\nWe propose that these long-range vibrations can be \\nthe possible candidates of inflation. To demonstrate this, we calculate the vac uum energy density created \\nby them. Here we define the vacuum energy to be the lowest energy state of the universal wave function.  \\nBecause our observed universe is the projection \\nfrom the world-sheet, the world sheet contains all the information, energy, and matter about our universe. All the vibrations in the observed space-time come from the vibrations in the world-sheet. Therefore, we simply need to calculate the vacuum energy in the \\ntwo-dimensional world sheet.  \\nTo calculate the vacuum energy of the world-sheet, \\nletâs assume that on the world-sheet, the energy is in the form of harmonic oscillator. The energy at the state (n, m) with the frequency Î½\\nn = n/T and \\nwavelength Î»m = L/m is: \\nEn,m = (n + Â½)h/T. \\nThe lowest energy of this vacuum fluctuation is \\nE0n,m = h/2T.  \\nThe number of possible vibrations on the world \\nsheet is TL/(t plp). We can get this from the uncertainty \\nrelation in Eq. (1). To make the space measurement âÏ, we should at least use the vibration with the \\nwavelength Î»\\nm = L/m ~ âÏ. To measure the time ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory .pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='Inflation Scheme Derived from Universal Wave Function Interpretation of String Theory 36\\nmeasurement âÏ, we should at least use the vibration \\nwith the frequency Î½n = n/T ~ âÏ. Since âÏâÏ  â¥ lptp, \\nwe get nm < TL/(t plp).  \\nThe total lowest vacuum energy is: \\nEvac = h/2T \\uf0b4 cTL/l p2 = hLc/(2l p2)   (8) \\nIt is proportional to the length of the causal horizon. \\nThe lowest vacuum energy density in the three dimensional space is: \\nÏ\\nvac = E vac/(4ÏL3/3) = Ïplp2/(2L2)    (9) \\nHere Ïp is the Planck energy density,  \\nÏp = E p /(4Ïlp3 /3), \\nand E p is the Planck energy E p = Ä§/tp = 1.956 \\uf0b4 109 \\nJoul, t p and l p are the Planck time and Planck length l p \\n= ct p = (Ä§G/c3)1/2.  \\nThe Eq. (9) tells us that the vacuum energy density \\nobserved in three space dimensions is inversely proportional to the square of the length of horizon L. At the beginning stage of universe, the vacuum energy density is very large. For example, when our universe is of the size of the Planck scale l\\np, the vacuum energy \\ndensity is half of the Planck energy density Ïvac = Ïp /2. \\nThis large vacuum energy density provides the energy source for inflation, the rapid initial expansion. Therefore, the result of Eq. (9) indicates the vacuum energy can be the energy source for inflation. As the universe expands to larger scale, the vacuum energy decreases, but is non-zero. Our universe will continue its accelerated expansion at much slower rate. \\nNow let us assume that L is the Hubble radius with \\nL = c/H. Here c is the speed of light and H is the Hubble constant. Hubble constant is the unit of measurement used to describe the expansion of the universe. It has also been used to estimate the age of our universe. With this assumption, we get: \\nÏ\\nvac = E vac/(4ÏL3 /3) = 3h/(8 ÏcL2lp2) = 3c2/(8ÏGL2) = \\n3H02/(8ÏG) = Ïc               (10) \\nSince the relation (8) is general for all L and T, it \\nshows that the lowest vacuum energy density is equal to the critical energy density for 4-dimensional \\nspace-time and remains to be  so as universe expands. \\nThis may provide further theoretical explanation why our universe is flat, with its energy density is so close \\nto critical energy density.  \\n4. Discussion and Conclusion \\nIn this paper, we propose a possible scheme of \\ninflation derived from the UWFIST. We demonstrate \\nthat this new development of string theory indicates the existence of long-range vibrations. These long-range vibrations could be the inflation. We estimate the vacuum energy created by them and find \\nthat they can propel the exponential expansion, the inflation, at the early stage of the universe. At the later \\ntime, the vacuum energy generated by them decreases significantly and the acceleration of the expansion gets much less.  \\nWe conclude that UWFIST provides a simple \\nexplanation and calculable prediction from the first principle about why our universe experiences fast inflation at the early stage, continue to expand, and at the same time remains very flat. It predicts that the inflation is the long-range vibrations. UWFIST gives a new possible scheme for inflation.  \\nIn our previous work, we show that the vacuum \\nenergy created by the inflation, the long-range vibrations, propels the current accelerated expansion of the universe. They ar e the dark energy. Our \\ncalculation agrees with the current observation about dark energy [9]. It can also explain the large-scale correlation observed in the large-scale anisotropies and non-Gaussian distributions of the cosmic microwave background and other background field as well as the anomalous alignments of the quadrupole and octupole modes [10].  \\nWe suggest UWFIST, as the new development in \\nstring theory, has shown the promise to yield testable theoretical predictions in astrophysics and cosmology. It is worth furthe r investigation.  \\nReferences \\n[1] Guth, Alan. 1998. The Inflationary Universe . Basic \\nBooks.  \\n[2] Steinhardt, Paul J., and Neil Turok. 2007.

It is the cause\\nof all change.\\nThe Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation includes the following three important\\npoints:\\n(1) Tao, the source of everything, is emptiness\\nThis is a profound spiritual wisdom known in many spiritual traditions. It is\\ninteresting that quantum physics can help us understand it scientiÂ¯cally. In\\nquantum physics, everything is described by a wave function. If we try to cal-\\nculate the wave function of emptiness, we Â¯nd that wave function of emptiness is\\ninÂ¯nite. This basically means that Tao, the emptiness, contains inÂ¯nite possi-bilities (information), energy and matter. Tao consists of everything.\\n(2) Everything, including every measurement, consists of two basic elements: Yin\\nand yang\\nThe relation between yin and yang consists of four aspects:\\n.Yin and yang are opposite;\\n.Yin and yang are relative;\\n.Yin and yang are co-created;\\n.Yin and yang are inseparable and co-dependent.\\nThe wisdom about yin and yang is based on the observation of a basic natural\\nlaw that everything has two sides, or two aspects, or two elements. For example,\\nthe up and the down parts are two aspects or elements within everything. They\\nare opposite. They are relative because the up part for someone could be the\\ndown part for others. They are co-created because when we say some part is up,\\nwe are comparing it with the part we think is down. They are inseparable and co-\\ndependent because there cannot be the up part without the down part and there\\ncannot be the down part without the up part.\\n(3) The interaction of yin and yang creates everything and is the cause of all change\\nThis is the core of the Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation. We give one example in\\nphysics that illustrates this. For instance, in quantum mechanics, everything is\\ndescribed by a wave function, /C9.

They are\\na pair of yin âyang. Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation basically tells us how the \\\\bit\"\\ncreates \\\\it\". In the following, we will explore how our universe is created according to\\nthis law.\\n3. The Creation of the Universe\\nWe propose that space and time are one of the fundamental yin âyang elements and\\nthat their interaction creates our universe.\\nFrom the quantum physics point of view, the universe we observe is determined\\nby our measurement. We propose that space and time are two basic measurements\\nwe conduct. Time relates to the measurement of movement and change. Space relates\\nto the measurement of stillness and solidity. For instance, the measurement of the\\nmovement of sand in an hourglass and the movements of the sun and the moon have\\nall been used as a measurement of time. The duration of a day is based on the\\nmeasurement of the rotation of the earth around its axis. The measurements of space,\\nsuch as the length, height and width of an object, are the measurement of its\\nunchangedness and stillness.\\nSpace and time are a yin âyang pair. Space and time are opposite and relative.\\nChange and stillness are opposites. They are relative because something may appear\\nto be a change to you but to be still to others. Albert Einstein\\'s relativity theory\\nproves to us that space and time are relative. Space and time are co-created because\\nwhenever we measure change, we are referring to something unchanged. Whenever\\nwe measure something as unchanged, we are comparing with something you consider\\nchanging. Therefore, space and time are inseparable and co-dependent.\\nWe propose that inclusion and exclusion are another yin âyang pair that is our\\nbasic measurement. All measurements are based on these two basic yin âyang pairs:\\nSpace âtime measurement and inclusive âexclusive measurement. For instance, the\\nmeasurement of velocity, acceleration, energy, momentum, temperature, spin, elec-\\ntricity, magnetic, mass, charge, force, mass and more are all variations of space andtime measurement and of inclusive and exclusive measurement. Since quantum\\nphysics tells us that our measurement determines our observation, which in this case\\nis the observed universe, we can therefore conclude and propose that these two yin â\\nyang pairs are the two fundamental yin âyang pairs whose interaction creates all of\\nthe phenomena in our universe.\\n4.

Conclusion\\nIn this work, we propose the Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation, which states that\\neverything is created through yin âyang interaction from emptiness.

This law\\nof creation basically tells us how information creates everything. It describes spe-\\nciÂ¯cally how \\\\it from bit\". We propose that space and time are a yin âyang pair.\\nSpace and time are two basic measurements we conduct. Time relates to the mea-\\nsurement of movement and change. Space relates to the measurement of stillness and\\nsolidity. We suggest and demonstrate mathematically that our universe is mani-\\nfested from the emptiness through the interaction of two yin âyang pairs: The space\\nand time yin âyang pair and the inclusion and exclusion yin âyang pair.\\nThe Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation proposed here gives us a new and deeper\\ninsight about space and time. Space and time are the basic actions and codes that\\nmanifest our universe. We Â¯nd that the Law of Tao Yin âYang Creation is not only\\nthe fundamental law and principle from which other physics theories, laws, ele-\\nmentary particles, fundamental forces and phenomena are created, it can also ad-\\ndress how every aspect of our lives is created.

The easy problem addresses the various mechanisms that the brain uses \\nto integrate information, categorize and discriminate environmental stimuli and memories, focus attention, and perform other tasks associated with conscious \\nexperience [5] [6]. Currently, although much progress has been made, neuro s-\\ncience continues to have difficulty in addressing the hard problem of consciou s-\\nness.  \\nMost research in neuroscience is based on classical physics. In this paper, we \\npropose that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon. Based on a new inte r-\\npretation of quantum physics, we propose a quantum theory of consciousness \\n(QTOC). We show that this quantum theory of consciousness can address both the hard and easy problem of consciousness and other challenging and unsolved problem in the science consciousness and neuroscience.  \\nPhysics studies what everything is made of and how it works. Physics uses \\nmathematical formulas to describe experimental data and make predictions, which can lead to new discoveries and technologies. Physics is the foundation of the natural sciences. Quant um physics is the most fundamental physics theory \\nso far [7] -[12]. It studies what everything is made of and how it works at the \\ndeepest level right now. Quantum physics makes the most precise predictions \\nand has enabled breakthrough progress in science and technology. For instance, development  in quantum physics has led to the discovery of the structure of \\nDNA, which reveals how life is reproduced [13].  \\nQuantum phenomena are the elementary, basic, and fundamental phenomena \\nunderlying all observed phenomena. For instance, quantum phenomena are what make the sun shine [14], due to the quantum effect, uncertainty o f location \\nand momentum, wavefunction overlap, and quantum tunneling. Classical phy s-\\nicsâsuch as Newtonian  mechanics and electromagnetics âis shown to be the \\naccumulative average of quantum phenomena and derivable from quantum physics [11].  \\n1.1. Four Reasons That Consciousness Should Be Studied with  \\nQuantum Physics  \\nDue to the current prevalent misunderstanding about quantum physics and tendency of ignoring it among researcher s in neuroscience and biology, here we \\nwant to list four major reasons about the importance to apply quantum physics \\nin the research and studies of consciousness and life science in general.  \\nBoth quantum phenomena and consciousness are subjective and non -deter-  \\nministic [7]. Indeed, it should not be considered coincidence that two of the \\nmost f undamental aspects of existence â\\ni.e., consciousness and quantum phe-\\nnomen aâshare the same subjective and probabilistic nature. Classical physics \\ndoes not have such nature. This is the first reason to use quantum physics to \\nstudy consciousness.  \\nQuantum physics uses wave function to studies the physical, energetic, and ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Quantum_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='G. S. Zhi, R. L. Xiu \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/jamp.2023.119174 2654 Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics  \\n informativ e aspects of an object. The informative aspect of an object âi.e., the \\ninformati on contained inside an object âis closely related to its consciousness. \\nClassical physics averages out the different possibilities represented by the i n-\\nformation [11]. As a result, it cannot address the informative/conscious nature \\nof our existence. This is the second reason why quantum physics is needed to \\nstudy consciousne ss. \\nThermodynamics and statistical physics study the relation between entropy, \\nenergy, pressure, and other physical aspects of an object. Entropy measures di s-\\norder, which is associated with the informative aspect of an object, as shown by \\nClaude Shannonâs information theory [15] . Max Tegmark [16]  estimates dec o-\\nherence time sc ales for ions involved in the propagation of action potentials to \\nbe 10 to 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the relevant time scales of neural \\ndynamics. He argues that the degrees of freedom of the human brain that relate to cognitive processes should b e thought of as a classic al rather than a quantum \\nsystem â\\ni.e., that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the current classi c-\\nal approach to neural network simulations.  \\nWe disagree with Tegmarkâs proposal because it ignores the order, correla-\\ntion, and coherence that exist and in fact dominate in the brain and life in ge n-\\neral. We propose and will show that âalthough decoherence as indicated by \\nTegmark exists in the brain and everything observed in nature âwhat leads to \\nconsciousness and life in general is the stable structure, order, connection, co r-\\nrelation, and coherence [17]  [18]. The connection, correlation, and coherence \\nthat underlie conscious experience are due to the established stable atomic, m o-\\nlecular, cellular, and other internal structures within the brain an d the whole \\nbody. These structures are obviously much stronger than the decoherence effects calculated by Tegmark; otherwise, there would be no stable atoms, molecules, \\ncells, brains, bodies, or life.  \\nTo study the consequence of structure, order, connecti on, and coherence, \\nquantum physics is needed. For instance, to study the simplest atomic stru c-\\ntureâ the hydrogen atom âNiels Bohr realized that it was necessary to use a new \\nphysics based on a set of new rules, \\ni.e. quantum physics. He helped found and \\ndevelop quantum physics, which led to the prediction of the relationship b e-\\ntween the hydrogen atomâs structure and spectrum [7] . The spectrum of a hy-\\ndrogen atom consists  of the vibrations that the hydrogen atom can resonate with \\nand emit. Life and consciousness are based on structure, order, connection, co r-\\nrelation, and coherence. Neural systems, membranes, microtubules, DNA, and \\nthe structures of living systems have grea ter similarity with crystals, semico n-\\nductor materials, superconductors, lasers, and superfluids. In classical mecha n-\\nics, the existence of such phenomena is impossible; they need to be studied with quantum physics. This is the third reason that quantum physics must be i n-\\nvolved in the study of consciousness.  \\nQuantum physics reveals that everything has both particle and wave nature \\n[7] [8] [9].

For instance, quantum physics is needed to understand even \\nsome of the simplest vibrational fields, su ch as black -body radiation and the \\nradiation spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Copious brainwaves are observed [19]. To study the relationship between brainwaves, brai n structure and fun c-\\ntion, and the information carried, received, and processed by the brain, quantum physics is needed. This is the fourth reason that the study of consciousness must necessarily involve quantum physics.  \\n1.2. Current Status on Using Quantu m Physics to Study  \\nConsciousness  \\nThe hesitation in applying quantum physics to study consciousness or life is due to the lack of true understanding about the metaphysical meaning of quantum \\nphysics. Currently, most physicists use quantum physics as a mathematical tool \\nto perform calculations related to the microscopic world, without fully appr e-\\nhending the overarching significance and implication of quantum physics.  \\nIn quantum physics, everything is described by a wavefunction, which po r-\\ntrays the proba bilities of an object existing in certain states. The observed qua n-\\ntum phenomena depend on the observer. The much -debated quantum me a-\\nsurement problem concerns how observed, subjective quantum phenomena \\narise from an objective and indeterministic quantum fi eld described by the \\nprobabilistic wavefunction. Various interpretations of quantum physics are proposed to address these paradoxes, including the Copenhagen interpretation \\n[8] [9], pilot -wave theories [20] , and many -world interpretations [21]  [22]. \\nWolfgang Pauli, John von Neumann, and Eugene Wigner, and more recently \\nHenry Stapp and philosopher David Chalmers, have expressed the view that \\nconscious observation \\ncauses  quantum state reduction âi.e., consciousness â col-\\nlapses the wavefunctionâ [23] [24] [25]. However, this dualistic view leaves both \\nconsciousness and quantum superposition scientifically unexplained.  \\nThe application of quantum physics in neuroscience has been explored in a \\nnumber  of books and papers [26] -[35]. A prominent theory among these pu b-\\nlished works has been developed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, who \\npropose self -collapse or âobjective reductionâ (âORâ) of quantum superposition \\nstates âa âcollapse of the quantum wavefunctionâ âas the possible non -com- \\nputable source for consciousness [36]  [37] [38]. Penrose [26]  [27] contends that \\ncollapse occurs naturally due to an objective threshold in the fine -scale structure \\nof the universe, such that events produce  the rudiments of phenomenal co n-\\nscious experience. Yet quantum state reduction is yet another mystery. In the 1960s, Luigi M. Ricciardi and Hiroomi Umezawa [33]  suggested using the fo r-\\nmalism of qu antum field theory to describe brain states, with particular empha-\\nsis on memory. This proposal has been further refined [39]  [40] [41] and deve l-\\noped by including effects of dissipation, chaos, fractals, and quantum noise [42]  \\n[43] [44] [45] [46]. Walter Jackson Freeman and Giuseppe Vitiello envision a \\nway in which mental activity can be explicitly explained in the context of qua n-\\ntum field theory [47]  [48] [49] [50].

Xiu \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/jamp.2023.119174 2656 Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics  \\n In our previous work [51]  [52] [53], we suggest a new interpretation of qua n-\\ntum physics, which can help explain the subjectivity and uncertainty inherent to \\nquantum ph ysics. In this paper, we build a quantum theory of consciousness \\n(QTOC) based on this work. In the following, we will first reveal the principles \\nof QTOC, then we will explore how QTOC can address the hard problem of \\nconsciousness, its application and pred ictions.  \\n2. Principles of Quantum  Theory of Consciousness (QTOC)  \\nWe propose a quantum theory of consciousness (QTOC) based on two pri n-\\nciples derived from our new interpretation of quantum physics [51] [52] [53].  \\nPrinciple  One  \\nThe basic  constituent  of everything  is the quantum  vibrational  field,  \\nwhich  carries  matter,  energy,  and information.  \\nThis principle derived from quantum physics suggests that everything is a v i-\\nbrational field [7]  [8] [9] [10] [11]. Vibration âalso called âwaveâ âis periodic \\noscillation extending over space and time, characterized by wavelength, fre-\\nquency, and amplitude. Quantum vibration also behaves like a particle in some ways, having specific mass, charge, spin, energy, and momentum. The exchange \\nof energy, momentum, spin, charge, and  mass can only take place wholly in \\nquanta instead of partially. The quantum vibrational field is mathematically d e-\\nscribed by a wavefunction, which shows the types and quantities of waves exist-\\ning in the field. Quantum physics has developed various techniques to calculate \\nwavefunction, such as the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, Feynman path integral, and \\nmatrix method. In the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum physics, \\nthe wavefunction is obtained by summing over possible trajectories [11].  \\nIn our previous work, we propose that the quantum vibrational field of an o b-\\nject has three basic aspects: a physical aspect, an energetic aspect, and an info r-\\nmational aspect [51] [52]: \\n1) The physical element âwhich we will call âmatterâ âis what we  see, hear, \\ntouch, observe, measure, and experience.

It consists of what one can observe and measure, such as frequency, mass, spin, charge, re-lationship, finance, career, body, electrons, gravity, electromagnetic field, etc.  \\n2) The energetic aspect âwhich we simply call âenergyâ âis what moves and \\nchanges matter, such as energy and momentum.  \\n3) The informational aspect âwhich we simply call âinformationâ âis what \\ninforms; it is what gives form and shape to the matter and energy.  It relates to \\nentropy, the possible states, and the probability to be in a particular state. Info r-\\nmation can be expressed as answers to questions.

It is also a natural deduction \\nfrom quantum physics. In quantum physics, wavefunction describes the vibr a-\\ntions and the vibrational field associate d with an object [7]  [8] [9] [10] [11]. \\nFrom the wavefunction, one can calculate the matter, energy, and information of \\nan object ca rried in the quantum vibrational field.  \\nAccording to the information theory founded by Claude Shannon [15] , in-\\nformation describes the possible states within an ob ject. Information is intrins i-\\ncally probabilistic. The probabilities of wave function describe the information \\nin an object. The nondeterministic nature of quantum physics is due to the fact that quantum physics includes and can describe the information asp ect of an \\nobject, while classical physics, except for thermodynamics, cannot describe the information aspect; the latter instead provides an average of different possibil i-\\nties [11]. The insight that everything is made of information, energy, and matter \\ncan explain why quantum physics is fundamentally uncertain and nondeterm i-\\nnistic. This insight is also the key for bringing consciousness into natural science \\nand expla ining the subjective and uncertain nature of consciousness. As e x-\\nplained further below, consciousness is closely related to the quantum field and \\ninformation aspect of everything.  \\nPrinciple  Two  \\nAn object  absorbs  quantum  vibrations  through  resonance.  The reception  \\nand processing  of vibrations âincluding  information,  energy,  and mat-\\nterâlead to subjective  conscious  experience.  \\nThe absorption of a quantum wave happens through resonance. The wavefunc-\\ntion reveals the possible energy states of an object and the p robabilities to be in \\nthe states. The object can absorb or emit vibrations that have the energy equal to \\nthe energy difference between these possible states [7] [12]. This process is called \\nâresonance.â If one knows the wavefunction of an object, it is possible to calc u-\\nlate specifically what kinds of vibrations it can reson ate with and thus receive or \\nemit [53]. From this calculation, one can obtain the spectrum of an object.  \\nQuantum phenomena occur through the measurement process, i n which de-\\ntectors are used to initiate, create, and exhibit quantum phenomena [51]  [52] \\n[53]. A detector is an instrument that can absorb vibrations and exhibit certain \\nchanges. For instance, a camera is a detector, which can absorb light and create a \\nphoto. A radioâs antenna is a detector that receives radio waves so that the radio \\nbroadcast can happen. Our eyes, ears, nose, and skin are all detectors. Detectors receive the vibrations, information, energy, and matter related to a phe nomenon \\nor an object, consequently bringing in matter, energy, and information, which \\nconsequently induce certain observable or measurable changes or experiences. \\nDetectors are what âcollapse the wavefunctionâ through receiving vibrations, information, ene rgy, and matter from what is being observed in QTOC. Qua n-\\ntum measurement occurs due to the detectors [51] [52] [53].  \\nOne can only observe the quantum vibrations and the associated phenomena \\nwhen the detectors can resonate with the v ibrations. For example, we can see ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Quantum_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='G. S. Zhi, R. L.

Specifically, the photoreceptor s in retina can absorb \\nthe visible light through resonance and then turn them into electrical signals, \\nwhich travel to the brain. Then the brain turns the signals into the images we \\nsee. We canât see ultraviolet light because we donât have the detector, ph otore-\\nceptors, to receive it.  \\nAn object or phenomenon can appear to be a classical object as a point rather \\nthan a vibrational field when the spatial and temporal scale of the vibrations as-\\nsociated with it are much smaller than the observation scale. For i nstance, a \\nbeam of visible light may appear as a particle, following a straight path, rather \\nthan a wave, because it vibrates at a frequency too fast and at a wavelength too \\nsmall for its wave nature to be observed. Classical physics provides an appropr i-\\nate description of quantum phenomena when the observation scale is much \\ngreater than the time scale of the quantum vibrations associated with the phe-\\nnomena. For instance, electrons, visible light, and protons may appear as par-\\nticles, when their quantum vibra tional time scales (10â20 seconds for an electron, \\n10â15 seconds for visible light, 10â23 seconds for a proton) are much smaller than \\nthe observation scale. In this case, our observation of them is the average over their possible quantum states, the classi cal mechanism description is sufficient.  \\nSimilar to quantum phenomena, consciousness occurs when one applies oneâs \\ninternal detectors to receive the vibrations, information, energy, and matter re-lated to an object or phenomenon. Each object has its unique  detectors deter-\\nmined by the possible vibrations it can absorb or emit, its spectrum. One can calculate an objectâs detectors, \\ni.e. its spectrum, using quantum physics. For i n-\\nstance, it is possible to calculate the hydrogen atomâs wavefunction. The stru c-\\nture of a hydrogen atom determines the possible quantum energy states. When a \\nvibrationâs energy is the same as the energy difference between the two possible states of a hydrogen atom, the vibration can be absorbed by a hydrogen atom. \\nThis process is called âresonanceâ in quantum physics. From the wavefunction, \\none can calculate all possible vibrations with which a hydrogen atom can res o-\\nnate. It yields the atomic spectrum and detector of a hydrogen atom. When an atom has more structure than hydrogen, its spe ctrum includes more possible v i-\\nbrations [55]. It can thus resonate with and absorb more vibrations. When \\natoms form molecules, when molecules form cells, when cells form organs, and when other internal structures form, the spectra and d etectors expand to include \\na greater range of frequencies that can be absorbed and emitted. As each add i-\\ntional structure is formed, the spectrum and detectors of the original structure \\nremain roughly the same, and new spectrum and detectors are added to fo rm \\nricher overall spectra and detectors.  \\nQuantum vibrations extend over spacetime. They are the basic constituents of \\neverything. They exist by themselves and are not carried by anything. For exa m-\\nple, a photon is a quantum field. It is an elementary particle and wave.

For example, sound is a \\nclassical vibration carried by air. An ocean wave is a classical vibration carried by water. The nature of classical vibrations depends on the specific matter through \\nwhich they are traveling. From the wavefunction, one can calculate both the \\nquantum and classical vibrations that an object can resonate with and receive.  \\nA moment of conscious experience starts when oneâs detectors receive vibra-\\ntions, info rmation, energy, and matter related to a phenomenon or an object, \\nthus inducing certain noticeable changes or experiences within. Oneâs detectors \\ndetermine what kind of conscious experiences one can have. The type of dete c-\\ntor determines what can be observed and experienced. If one turns on different detectors, oneâs experience will be different. This is the basis of the subjective \\nnature of consciousness. This is why the same thing can be experienced diffe-\\nrently by different observers. One can also have dif ferent experience about the \\nsame thing if one applies different detectors. For example, with normal camera \\nthat can capture the visible light, we can obtain a photo showing the image of \\nvisible light. With a camera that can capture infrared light, we obtai n a photo \\nshowing the image of infrared light. With our eyes, we see visible light images. With our ears, we hear sound. They are different phenomena and experience because we use different detectors.  \\nIn \\nFigure 1 , it shows that everythi ng is a vibrational field, which is mathe-\\nmatically expressed by wave function:  \\n()\\n1ennNiEt px\\nn\\nnaÏâ\\n==â\\uf068 \\nThe wave function informs the possible energetic states ( ,nnEp ) and the \\nprobabilities  na at these states, which relate to the energy and information of \\nan object.

Address the Hard Problem of Consciousness  \\nThe hard problem of consciousness âalso called the âmind/body problemâ âis \\nto understand how matter such as the human brain is capable of hav ing subje c-\\ntive experience [3]  [4] [56]. David Chalmers points out that the solution of hard \\nproblem of consciousness requires âpsychophysical lawsâ governing the rel a-\\ntionship between mind and matter. To solve the hard problem of consciousness, \\nDavid Chalmers proposes three speculative principles [4] : \\n1) The  principle  of structur al coherence  \\nThis is a principle of the isomorphism between the structures of consciousness \\nand awareness.  \\nIn QTOC, consciousness depends on the detectors. Awareness is due to the \\nactivation and use of detectors. Both consciousness and awareness are due to the reception of detectors; thus, they are correlated.  \\n2) The  principle  of organizational  invariance  \\nThis principle states that any two systems with the same fine -grained func-\\ntional  organization will have qualitatively identical experiences.  \\nIn QTOC, oneâs vibrational field âwhich is mathematically described by the \\nwavefunction âdetermines all of oneâs qualities and behaviors, including its de-\\ntectors and processors of information, energy, and matter. If two systems have a \\nsimilar wavefunctionâ i.e., have the same fine -grained function organiz a-\\ntionâthey will have qualitatively identical experiences.  \\n3) The  double -aspect  theory  of information  \\nInformation (or at least some information) has two basic aspects: a physical \\naspect and a phenomenal aspect.  \\nIn QTOC, information is carried by vibrational fields, which is the physical \\naspect of information. One can ex perience the information through oneâs detec-\\ntors and processors of information. Therefore, information has both physical \\nand experiential aspects.  \\nOne can thus conclude that the three principles suggested by David Chalmers \\ncan all be derived from QTOC. In  this QTOC, mind is closely related to the i n-\\nformation. In previous work [51]  [52], we point out that information has three \\naspects:  \\n1) Content of information  \\n2) Receiver/detector of information  \\n3) Processor of information  \\nOne can calculate oneâs receiver and processor of information from oneâs \\nwave function. Conscious experience occurs through the following process: \\n1) Some information in the vibrational field or environment receivable to the \\nobserver shows up and draws the observer's attention  \\n2) The observer or experiencerâs receiver/detector receives the information.  \\n3) The processor processes the received information and directs where energy \\ngoes. \\n4) Energ y moves and changes the matter.  \", metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Quantum_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='G.

The two principles specify the quantum \\nmechanism about how the body can have conscious experience and how co n-\\nsciousness can change the body.  \\nThrough laying down how the subjective and indeterministic quantum phe-\\nnomena occu r through quantum measurement, QTOC can address the hard \\nproblem of consciousness.  \\n4. Applications and Predictions of QTOC  \\n4.1. Application in Developing Various Models of Consciousness  \\nQTOC supports panpsychism [57] . It indicates that everything âincluding ele c-\\ntrons, atoms, molecules, cells, organs, trees, rivers, mountains, Earth, moon, sun, \\nstars, galaxies, and the universe as a whole âcan each have cons ciousness to a \\ncertain extent because they all contain information, can receive and process in-formation, and experience resultant change accordingly. One can use quantum \\nphysics to calculate the level, quality, and quantity of the consciousness of an \\nobjec t. To do so, one needs to calculate the objectâs wavefunction. From the w a-\\nvefunction, one can derive the content, receiver, and processor of information, \\nenergy, and matter.  \\nQTOC provides the physics foundation and mathematical formulation to \\nstudy panpsy chism and other theories and models of consciousness, such as i n-\\ntegrated information theory [58] , general resonance theory [59]  [60], field mo d-\\nels [61] [62] [63], global workspace theory of consciousness [64] [65], theory of \\nconsciousness as memory and attention [66] [67], and other models and theories \\nof consciousness [5] . For instance, with QTOC, one can calculate the integrated \\ninformation proposed in integrated information theory, the coherence and syn-chrony suggested in general resonance theory, the field indicated in field theory, \\nthe cognitive global workspace proposed in the cognitive global workspace \\ntheory, and the memory and attention indicated in the theory of consciousness \\nas memory and attention.  \\nTake the global workspace theory of consciousness as an example. The global \\nworkspace theory of consciousness proposes that there is a âglobal workspaceâ system underlying con scious experience. The global workspace is the publicity \\norgan of the nerve system, and its content âwhich corresponds roughly to co n-\\nscious experienceâ is distributed widely throughout the system. The brain is \\nconsidered as a vast collection of specialized a utomatic processors, some nested \\nand organized within other processors. Processors can compete or cooperate to \\ngain access to the global workspace, enabling them to send global messages to \\nany other system. Any conscious experience emerges from cooperation  and \\ncompetition between different input processors.  \\nAccording to QTOC, everything is essentially a quantum vibrational field e x-\\ntending over space and time and carrying information, energy, and matter.

Xiu \\n \\n \\nDOI: 10.4236/jamp.2023.119174 2662 Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics  \\n cause of this, there exists a universal vibrational  field which everything is part of \\nand can access to [51]. This quantum vibrational field plays the role of the global \\nworkspace. The assumption of a global workspace and global messaging in glo b-\\nal workspace theory can be a natural result of QTOC. H owever, there is a crucial \\ndifference between the universal vibrational field suggested by QTOC and that \\ndiscussed in the global workspace theory of consciousness. The universal vibr a-\\ntional field suggested by QTOC is much larger than the localized global w ork-\\nspace in global workspace theory. It exists not only within the brain, but also encompasses the whole body and indeed the entire universe. It can be accessed \\nby everything.  \\n4.2. The Prediction of a Universal Vibrational Field and  \\nSynchrony  \\nThe nature of quantum vibrations is its possible existence in all space and time. \\nBecause of this, a natural prediction from QTOC is the existence of a universal \\nvibrational field, of which everything is part, to which everything can access i.e. \\nreceive or send vibra tions, information, energy, matter from or to it.  \\nDifferent parts of the brain and body can receive vibrations from the universal \\nvibrational field depending on the range of vibrations with which they are able to resonate. The types of vibrations that a p articular part of the body can res o-\\nnate with and absorb depend upon its atomic, molecular, cellular, neuronal, and other internal structures. If different parts of the body or brain resonate with and \\nreceive the same group of vibrations from the universal vibrational field, their \\nstates or vibrations can become synchronized or coherent with each other. This \\nis similar to the process that if everyone tunes oneâs clock with a universal clock, \\neveryone can become synchronized with each other quickly. This is a lso similar \\nto the mechanism of how a laser is created. Laser is coherent light. It is created \\nby the light emitted from a crystal bouncing back and forth between two mirrors \\nto stimulate the generation of the coherent light.  \\nThere are experiments indicati ng the correlation between cognitive perfo r-\\nmance and heart rhythm [68] . Social and global coherence has been discovered, \\nfor instance, through heart rhythm synchron ization between pairs of people and \\nin groups, as well as with the resonant frequencies in Earthâs magnetic field [69]  \\n[70]. It has been discovered that the heart rhythm of humanity can be synchr o-\\nnized interpersonally across the planet with the resonant frequency of the \\nEarthâs magnetic field. The impact of solar activity on Earth weather and human \\nhistory, including mental life and activity, has been observed [71]  [72] [73] [74] \\n[75]. All of these findings suggest that the effect of the u niversal vibrational field \\nextends far beyond the brain and body, encompassing the whole of humanity, Earth, and the solar system.  \\n4.3.

The similarity between brainwaves such as alpha (8 -  12 Hz), \\nbeta (12 -  30 Hz), and gamma (30 -  100 Hz) with SRs and the tendency of ele c-\\ntroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms to become synchronous with SR activity was \\nfirst reported by Koenig [72] . Pobachenko et al.  [73] found that variations in \\nEEG were correlated with changes in the SR across the daily cycle. Persinger et \\nal. have also studied EEG activity and SR, finding that the power within the EEG \\nspectral profiles had repeated periods of coherence with the first three SR re-\\nsonance frequencies (7 - 8 Hz, 13 - 14 Hz, and 19 - 20 Hz) in real time [74].  \\nThis repeat ed re- synchronization within the alpha, beta, and gamma ranges of \\nbrainwaves happens within very short time lags covering very long distances. \\nThe dominant mechanism within classical physics for neural interactions by \\naxodendritic synaptic transmission or gap junction coupling cannot fully ac-\\ncount for the precise coherence of global brainwave synchrony [75]  [76]. Free-\\nman and Vitiello apply many -body quantum field theory developed in co n-\\ndensed matter physics to describe these long -range coherent brainwaves [76] . \\nHunt and Schooler propose general resonance theory to explain how resonating \\nstructures communicate and achieve shared resonance [59]. However, the sp e-\\ncific mechanism remains unknown in these theories.  \\nAccording to QTOC, the similarity between SR and theta, alpha, beta, gamma, \\nand other brainwaves is not a coincidence. Alpha, beta, gamma, and other brainwaves come from the ability of the brain to resonate with SR, which is part \\nof the universal quantum vibrational field. These resonances bring the SR inside \\nthe brain. If different parts of the brain can resonate with SR, then they can re-ceive and emit brainwaves in the range of SR. Through this process, they can e s-\\ntablish coherence with SR. This can lead to synchrony among different parts of the brain. The SRs going back and forth inside our brain can stimulate different parts of the brain simultaneousl y. This is why instantaneous synchrony and c o-\\nherence of different parts of the brain occurs in alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (12 -  30 \\nHz), gamma (30 - 100 Hz), and possibly other brainwave frequency bands. This \\ntype of coherence and synchronicity can also happen  between different parts of \\nthe body, people, and different objects on Earth, as have been shown in exper i-\\nments [68]-[75].  \\nIt is necessary to point out that theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and other brain-\\nwaves are just one groups of brainwaves. There are lot of other brainwaves which come from the resonances with other vibrations  in the universal vibr a-\\ntional field.  \\nOne may be curious about why the body developed the ability to resonate with \\nSR. The reason could be that developing the ability to resonate with these vibr a-\\ntions enables the body to receive and send information, energ y, and matter from \\nand to the Earth as well as all other entities situated on this planet. For example, humans and other life forms such as plants and animals develop the ability to resonate with and receive visible light, which carries information, energy , and \\nmatter from the sun through these vibrations.

This information, energy, and \\nmatter  can be vital for survival, vitality, health, well -being, immunity, commu-\\nnication, inspiration, purpose and meaning of life, and for physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health and development. Being able to resonate with these vibrations can also he lp one to connect with each other, the Earth, sun, g a-\\nlaxy, and universe. This can enable life and consciousness to advance to higher \\nlevels, which involve ever- greater degrees of connection, order, synchrony, and \\ncomplexity. This could be an important rese arch direction to further probe the \\nmysteries of the brain, consciousness, and life in general. \\n \\n4.4. Study Brainâs Neural Network as a Quantum Information  \\nSystem  \\nAccording to QTOC, we need to study the brainâs neural network as a quantum \\ninformation syst em. Recent years have seen great progress in the research of \\nquantum information theory [77] , which is not only at the heart of modern i n-\\nformation technology, but a lso provides new angles, tools, and methods in many \\nareas. Here we apply it to study neural networks.  \\nQuantum information science provides an information- theoretic under-\\nstanding of correlation, especially the new concepts called âquantum entangl e-\\nmentâ and  âentanglement entropy.â Normal entropy measures the degree of \\ndisorder and uncertainty existing within an object. Entanglement entropy mea s-\\nures the connection, correlation, and coherence existing within an object or b e-\\ntween objects. Thousands of research papers studying the properties of quantum \\nentanglement have been published in the past two decades. The main result is \\nthat the interaction and connection among neighboring units (e.g., spins, ele c-\\ntrons, protons, atoms, molecules, neurons, cells, synapses)  can lead to entangl e-\\nment and bring about long- range order and various phase transitions. Some of \\nthe new phase states are nothing but the patterns of many -body entanglement. \\nThe nontrivial patterns of entanglement are the root of many highly novel ph e-\\nnome na in condensed matter [77] .  \\nAny quantum system inevitably interacts with the environment and leads to \\ndecoherence. To protect a system against noise, quantum error -correcting codes \\nare developed. The main idea of the error- correcting codes is to spread  the one \\nqubit quantum information onto a highly entangled state of several qubits. In \\nthis way, errors caused by decoherence from the environment can be corrected or reduced.  \\nResearch in the formation of memory in the brain indicates that memory is \\nthe reactivation of a specific group of neurons, formed from persistent firings that lead to changes in the strength of connections between neurons. Since Karl \\nLashleyâs experimental work in the 1940s, it has been known that many fun c-\\ntional activities of the brain cannot be directly related to specific neural cells; r a-\\nther, they involve extended regions of the brain [78]  [79]. The description of \\nnonlocality of brain functions, especially of memory storing and recalling, was \\nthe main goal of the quantum brain model proposed in 1967 by Ricciardi and ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Quantum_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='G.

The extension of the model to dissipative dynamics has been recently \\ninvestigated [9] in relation to the possibility of modeling neural networks exhi-\\nbiting collective dynamics and long- range correlations among the net units.  \\nFrom the quantum information theory point of view, the rich structures i n-\\nside proteins, DNA, microtubules, membranes, neurons, and neural network \\ngive rise to entanglement, coherence, and correlation. Instantaneous and coh e-\\nrent firings in the brainâs neural network are critical for forming the connections \\nand interaction among neurons. These interactions can establish new entangl e-\\nment and coherence, which can lead to special states or phase transition. From the quant um information theory point of view, memory corresponds to the \\nunique new entangled states and the phase transition to a new coherent state.  \\nIt is interesting to notice that our brain has developed and is naturally using \\nquantum error correction codes to protect memory. Each neuron contains thousands or tens of thousands of synapses, which are connected through the \\nsame cell body thus is quantum entangled. Each of synapse can take on the same \\nquantum info. All the synapses in each neuron can hold copies of the same \\nquantum information. In this way, quantum information is spread onto a highly \\nentangled state of several pieces. In this way, errors caused by decoherence from \\nthe environment can be corrected or reduced. The neural system uses er-\\nror-correcting c ode to protect the entanglement and the memory.  \\nQuantum entanglement exists not only on the neuronal level; it is also preva-\\nlent at the vibrational level. It is critical for understanding brainwaves and their relationship with consciousness, brain structu res and functions, as well as DNA \\nstructure, functions, and expression. Studying the brainâs neural network, DNA, \\nand life system as a quantum information system may lead to deeper and greater \\nbreakthrough in studying consciousness and life in general.  \\n5. Discussion and Conclusion  \\nIn this paper, we suggest that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon. The so-\\nlution of quantum measurement problem can lead to the solution of hard pro b-\\nlem of consciousness. We propose a quantum theory of consciousness (QTOC) \\nbased on a new interpretation of quantum physics. In this QTOC, everything \\narises from a vibrational field carrying matter, energy, and information, which \\ncan be mathematically described in terms of wavefunction. Conscious exp e-\\nrience occurs through the act ivation and application of body that can receive vi-\\nbrations via resonance or information, energy, and matter. This QTOC provides the physics foundation and mathematical formulation to:  \\n1) Address the hard problem of consciousness.  \\n2) Develop various models of consciousness and extend existing theories.  \\n3) It predicts the existence of a universal quantum vibrational field, which \\neverything can access, receive, and send information, energy, and matter.  \\n4) Explain the large -scale and almost instantaneous sy nchrony of brainwaves \\nsuch as gamma, beta, and alpha brainwaves and why and how these brainwaves ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Quantum_Theory_of_Consciousness.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='G.

Current natural science cannot answer this question at the fundamental level. In this work, we combine the ancient Chinese Tao wisdom about the creation with quantum physics. We propose that everything comes from the emptiness. Our universe is manifested from the emptiness through two pairs of duality measurements: space and time duality pair and inclusion and exclusion duality pair. From this understanding, we are able to derive one mathematic formula describing our universe. It also yields a new metaphysical approach to derive and interpret string theory as well as produce more testable predictions from string theory. This work gives a new way to understand and mathematically describe how our universe is created and evolved. It provides another way to comprehend the meaning and function of space and time. It indicates that our universe is manifested from the emptiness through human actions. Space and time is a pair of duality action and codes that help manifest our universe. It provides answer to an important philosophical question about whether and why we can understand and mathematically describe our universe.  Keywords: space, time, creation of universe, string theory, Tao wisdom, quantum physics, measurement theory, duality, manifestation, grand unification theory  Understanding the secret about creation is one of the highest wisdom, knowledge, and enlightenment a human being can dream about. This wisdom and knowledge will not only empower us to become a powerful manifest or, more importantly, it is essential for liberating humanity from illusions, sufferings, limitations, lacking, ignorance, and bondage. This wisdom is the doorway to a higher level of consciousness and enlightenment.  More than 300 years ago, Issac Newton, together with other pioneers, enlightened humanity with the profound truth that planets, stars, mother earth, humane, and all things follow the same physics law. With the language of our mind, the mathematics, we can understand and grasp the natural laws that govern everyone and everything. This sets up the foundation for what we now call scientific study, which is to use mathematic formula to express repeatable experiment to seek deeper understanding of nature. The founding of scientific study has deep and powerful impact on humanity. The whole history of humanity has changed because of it.

Humanityâs power to impact nature started to grow exponentially. Quantum physics is the most fundamental physics theory so far. It has been shown that classical physics can be derived from quantum physics mathematically as an approximation. Quantum physics yields the most accurate predictions about nature. It has expanded our knowledge about nature tremendously, in areas such as chemistry, material science, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics, as well as astrophysics, cosmology, and more. It has also led to an immense number of new inventions and technologies.  Quantum physics studies what everything is made of and how it behaves at the microscopic level. Studies in quantum physics indicate that everything is made of various vibrations, also called waves. Vibration or wave is the same as periodic oscillation. Because quantum vibrations are not limited by space and time, everything is basically a vibrational field consisting of different vibrations. It is described by wave function mathematically. Wave function is the mathematical formula that expresses the types and quantity of vibrations or waves inside a system.  Quantum physics drastically challenges the foundation of natural science in three ways: predictability, objectivity, and locality of natural phenomena. Understanding quantum physics metaphysically is still an active pursuit in physics and philosophy. Many scientists question whether quantum physics is a complete or correct theory about reality. Many interpretations have been proposed to make sense of quantum physics.  Astrophysics and cosmology attempt to explore our universe with insight, mathematic formula and experimental data. Astrophysics is a branch of physics that studies what is made of the heavenly bodies, such as sun, stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, interstellar medium, and the cosmic microwave background. Cosmology studies the origin, evolution, large-scale structures, dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern the universe.  Much observation data indicate that our universe starts from a big bang, followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation, an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 billion years ago. The existence of dark energy is proposed to describe the unknown energy source for the observed accelerated expansion of our universe. Dark matter is suggested to account for the unknown matter necessary for the appearance of the large-scale structure detected in our universe.  The grand unification theory, also called the theory of everything, is the attempt to use one mathematic formula to explain all the fundamental forces and matters discovered so far. String theory is a promising candidate for the grand unification theory. String theory studies the quantum dynamics of a string. The vibration of string creates particles and forces. String theory has the potential to predict the dimension of space-time, the particle and interaction spectrum, to unify all the forces and fundamental particles, and more. However, with all these great potentials and promises, string theory has not yet made many testable predictions. Something is still missing if string theory will ever become the grand unification theory.  Even with all its achievement, current physics, astrophysics, cosmology, string theory, as well as all the candidates of grand unification theory, cannot answer the question about where our universe comes from and how it is created at the fundamental level. In this paper, we explore to apply Tao wisdom about the creation to the theoretical physics. We will mathematically formulate Tao wisdom and derive the one formula about our universe. We will first give a summary of Tao wisdom about creation. Then we will explore the meaning and function of space-time at a fundamental level. We propose that at the deeper level, space-time is one of the two yin-yang pairs that manifest our universe from the emptiness.

Ancient Tao Wisdom Tao is an ancient Chinese natural philosophy, tradition, ethic, spiritual practice, and wisdom with a written history of about 5000 years. It has greatly influenced Chinese culture in every aspect. It starts to impact more and more people worldwide. According to Tao wisdom, Tao is the emptiness. It is the origin and creator of everyone, everything, and our whole universe. Everything comes in existence through yin yang interaction. Yin yang is the basic universal code and driving force behind all creation and change in the universe.  Yin yang is one of the most ancient Chinese wisdom and concept. This wisdom and concept is the origin and foundation for all Chinese wisdom, culture, logic, ideology, and philosophy. Yin and yang represent two opposite elements existing in everyone and everything. Usually, yin represents the part that is passive, dark, contracting, feminine, down. Yang represents the part that is active, light, expanding, masculine, and up.  The wisdom of yin yang tells us that everyone and everything consist of both yin and yang elements. The relation between yin and yang includes four aspects: (1) Yin and yang are opposite and relative  (2) Yin and yang are co-created (3) Yin and yang are inseparable and co-dependent (4) The interaction of yin and yang creates everyone and everything. It is the cause of all changes.  In ancient Chinese book, Yellow Emperorâs Cannon, it is said: âYin yang is the universal principle. It is the fundamental law followed by everyone and everything. It is the origin of all changes. It is the cause of birth and death. It is the reason of all creation.â According to Tao wisdom, Tao is the emptiness. Tao creates everyone and everything through the Tao normal creation process: âTao Sheng Yi. Yi Sheng Er. Er Sheng San. San Sheng Wan Wu.â  Here Sheng means create. Yi means one. Er means two. San means three. Wang wu means all things. The literal translation of the above phrase is: Tao creates One. One creates Two. Two creates Three. Three creates All Things. This ancient text tells us that Tao creates a oneness state. This oneness state can split into a yin yang pair. Yin, Yang, and Tao, these three elements, create all things.  2. The Quantum Physics about Tao  What is Tao according to physics? Can science help us understand Tao?  In physics, emptiness is sometimes called vacuum. In classical physics, emptiness is nothingness. There is nothing in the emptiness. In quantum physics, the emptiness is not nothingness any longer. Vibrations can pop out of as well as go back to the emptiness. This phenomenon is the so called the vacuum fluctuation. Since there is no blockage in the emptiness, all sorts of vibrations can show up in the emptiness through the quantum fluctuation.  In fact, when quantum physicists attempt to calculate the information, energy, and matter in the emptiness, they encounter the infinity. Infinity is something so huge or so small it cannot be counted. It is bigger than the biggest. It is smaller than the smallest. Within emptiness, there are countless information, energy, and matter.   Infinity is one of the most challenging problems physicists have ever run into. In fact, encountering ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Space, Time, and the Creation of Universe.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='SPACE, TIME, AND THE CREATION OF UNIVERSE \\n 69 infinity is quite a scaring experience. At the beginning, physicists choose to ignore the infinity associated with the emptiness. After all, nothing in this world is emptiness. However, they cannot shun away from the infinity and the emptiness very long. Soon they find that, in quantum physics, matter interacts with the emptiness. This interaction can also create infinity.  To avoid the infinity problems associated with the emptiness, physicists came up with renormalization procedure to calculate how the emptiness affects the measurable quantities, such as charge, mass, energy, and other observable quantities. Renormalization theory reveals one important fact: Natural phenomena may appear different when observed at different space and time scale.  Letâs summarize what quantum physics tells us about Tao, the emptiness: (1) Emptiness contains boundless information, energy, and matter.  (2) Emptiness is within everything.  (3) Emptiness interacts with everything. 3. The Quantum Physics about Creation Quantum phenomena challenge one of the corner stones of natural science: objectivity. It is generally accepted in natural science that natural phenomena are objective. Their existence does not depend on the action of the observer. In quantum physics, however, phenomena are subjective and depend on the action of observers.  In quantum physics, the world we observed is determined by our action of the observer. Quantum measurement is the action of observation. The measurement process is a determining factor for what is being observed. It is in fact part of the process that creates the quantum phenomena. The world we observed is manifested by our measurement in quantum physics.  This is a revolutionary revelation. The implication of this revelation has not been paid enough attention by most physicists and scientists. In the following we will show, the combination of the full grasp of this revelation with the Tao wisdom can help us understand the creation of our universe and come up with the grand unification theory.  4. Meaning and Function of Space and Time How does the yin yang interaction manifest the universe from the emptiness? To answer this question, we first need to find out the yin yang pairs that create our universe. To do this, we need to understand what space and time is, as the creation of our universe relates to space and time.  Space and time are two mysteries that have been explored by all people in all cultures, traditions, ideologies, philosophies, and sciences in history. Space and time have many layers of meaning and applications. For instance, some people think time is life. Some people consider time and space is money.  In the 17th century, understanding about space and time emerged as a central issue in founding science. Gottfried Leibniz and Issac Newton led two opposing theories about space and time. Gottfried Leibniz, a German philosopher-mathematician, believes that space and time does not exist. They are no more than the collection of and an idealized abstraction from the relations between objects and events.  Issac Newton, the founder of classical mechanics, views space and time as absolute in the sense that it exists permanently and independently of whether there was any matter or observer.  George Berkeley, an Anglo-Irish philosopher, proposed âimmaterialism.â His theory denies the existence of material substance. It suggests that the objects such as tables, chairs, space, and time are only ideas in the ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Space, Time, and the Creation of Universe.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='SPACE, TIME, AND THE CREATION OF UNIVERSE \\n 70 minds of perceivers, as a result cannot exist without being perceived.  In the 18th century, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed a theory of knowledge. Kant came to the realization that space and time is not the objective feature of the world. Space and time is a framework used by us to organize our experience. Under the influence of Austrian physicist and philosopher, Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach, Einstein founded relativity theory. Einstein finds that space and time is relative. They are connected and can transform into each other. Space and time are two different aspects of one entity, spacetime.  Quantum physics challenges both Newtonâs and Einsteinâs concept about space and time in the most dramatic way. Quantum phenomena challenge Einsteinâs assumption that the transfer of information cannot exceed the speed of light. Quantum entanglement phenomena provide a way to transfer information instantly. Quantum entanglement means that the states of two or more vibrations are connected. When one or more vibrations are observed as certain states, the other vibrations with which it is quantum entangled will instantly turn into the state that is determined by the quantum entanglement no matter how far they are from each other.  Quantum physics also defies our normal ideas about space and time in a profound way. For instance, quantum phenomena reveal that we cannot measure time and energy simultaneously with the complete accuracy. We also cannot measure space and momentum simultaneously with the complete accuracy. This is the uncertainty principle in quantum physics. The measurement of space and time is not trivial action in quantum physics. It is not simply assigning a number to a ruler, clock, or event. The observation and measurement of space and time is a creation process for the phenomena we observe.  5. The Deeper Meaning and Function of Space and Time We suggest space and time is one of the fundamental yin-yang codes that manifest our universe from the emptiness. Time relates to the measurement of movement and change. It is the yang aspect of the yin-yang code. Space relates to the measurement of stillness and solidity. It is the yin aspect of the yin-yang code.  As we have mentioned before, quantum physics tells us that the world we observed is manifested by our measurement. Space and time relate to a pair of basic human duality actions. Fundamentally, time and space are two types of duality measurement. Time is the measurement of change. For instance, the measurement of the movement of sand in a container, the burning of incense, and the movement of sun and moon, has all been used as a measurement of time. The duration of a day is based on the measurement of rotation of the earth around itself. The length of lunar month is related to the movement of the moon around the earth. A year is the measurement of the evolution of earth around the sun. Space is the measurement of unchangeness and stillness. The length, height, and width of an object are the measurement of its unchangeness and stillness. We suggest that space and time is a yin-yang pair. Space and time is opposite and relative. Change and stillness are opposite. They are relative because something may appear to change to you but to be still to others. Space and time is co-created because whenever we measure change we are referring to something unchanged. Whenever we measure unchanged, we are comparing to something changing. Therefore, space and time is inseparable and co-dependent. We propose that the interaction of space and time creates the universe. We will demonstrate this point below. There is another yin yang pair also involved in the creation of our universe. This other yin yang pair is inclusion and exclusion. The inclusion and exclusion is a fundamental action we are doing all the time. We ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Space, Time, and the Creation of Universe.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='SPACE, TIME, AND THE CREATION OF UNIVERSE \\n 71 either include or exclude something in our actions.  Letâs examine our action more closely. We find that all measurement is based on these two basic yin yang pairs, space-time measurement, and inclusive-exclusive measurement. For instance, the measurement of velocity, acceleration, energy, momentum, temperature, spin, electricity, magnetic, mass, charge, force, and more are all variations of space and time measurement and inclusive and exclusive measurement. Some people may think the measurement of mass or temperature is unique. However, if you examine the different ways to measure mass or temperature, you will see that they are all different variations of the space and time measurement and inclusive and exclusive measurement. For instance, to measure mass with a balance, we put the matter to be measured on one side of the balance and the matter with known mass on the other side. When both sides of the balance are completely balanced, we obtain the completely equal mass on the both sides. In this way, the unknown mass is measured. In this measuring process, the space and time measurement is used to make sure that the two arms of the balance are equal and still. The inclusion and exclusion measurement is applied when one adds known mass to the balance.  In one word, all the measurements are different variation and combination of space and time measurement and inclusive and exclusive measurement. With the assumption that our action manifests the universe, these two yin yang pairs are the two fundamental yin yang pairs that manifest all of the phenomena in our universe.  6. The Derivation of Wave Function of the Universe To see how the interaction of these two yin-yang pairs manifests our universe, we need to write down the action created by the interaction of these two yin yang pairs. In physics, action is an attribute of the dynamics of a physical system from which the equations of motion of the system can be derived. It depends on the trajectory, the path or history of the system.  The simplest action created by the interaction of the space-time yin yang pair is: A1=Î±Ã²DtDs          (1) Here we use the symbol s to represent space and the symbol t to represent time. We use Ds and Dt to represent the space and time duration to be measured. The symbol Ã² represents the summation over space and time from the beginning t=0 and s=0 till now t=T and s=L. Here T is the age of our universe and L is the horizon of our universe. And Î± is a constant. In our recent work, we have shown that: Î±=1/(lptp)           (2) Here tp is the Planck time. It is of the magnitude of 5.4Ã10-44 second. It is the smallest time scale that naturally comes out of mathematic formula about nature so far. Here lp is the Planck length. It is of the magnitude of 1.6Ã10-35 meter. It is the smallest length that naturally comes out of mathematics formula about nature so far.  To introduce the second yin yang pair into the action, it is important to realize that corresponding to the inclusion and exclusion yin yang pair, in nature there exist two types of particles, fermions, and bosons. Fermions have half (1/2) spin. They repel each other. They refuse to be in the same state. Particles such as electrons, muons, neutrinos, and quarks are fermions. Bosons have integer spin. They tend to clump. They love to stay at the same state together. Particles such as photons, gravitons, and gluons are bosons. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is the symmetry originally proposed to connect fermions and bosons. The normal time and space coordinates t and s are of bosonic nature. If we assume each space or time coordinate has both the fermion (yang, repulsive) and boson (yin, clumping) parts, each time and space coordinate become two elements: ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Space, Time, and the Creation of Universe.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='SPACE, TIME, AND THE CREATION OF UNIVERSE \\n 72 t ->(t, Î¸t)           (3) s ->(s, Î¸s)          (4) Here we use Î¸s and Î¸t to represent the fermion partner of space and time coordinate s and t. The Î¸s and Î¸t can only take on the value 0 or 1 because they are repulsive and refuse to stay at the same place with another element. The s, t, Î¸s, and Î¸t represent the four elements of the two yin yang pairs, space time yin yang pair and inclusion and exclusion yin yang pair.   The simplest action created by these two yin yang pairs is: A2=Î±Ã²DtDsD Î¸tD Î¸s         (5) The symbol Ã² is to represent the summation over space s and time t and Î¸t and Î¸s. It is amazing to see that the action A1 is similar to the action that creates string theory and the action A2 is similar to the action that creates the superstring theory except for one difference. The action A1 and A2 sum over the life span and horizon of our universe while the string theory and superstring theory set the length of the string at the Planck scale lp and they set the time to the infinity.  In Quantum physics, everything is mathematically represented by wave function. Using Feynmanâs path integral formulation, we can calculate the wave function Î¨ created by the action A1 and A2. The Feynmanâs path integral formulation of quantum physics is a way to calculate a quantum amplitude or wave function by summing over the all possible trajectories. It generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics and replaces the classical notion of a single definite trajectory with a summation over all possible trajectories. According to this method, the wave function created by the action A2 is in the form: Î¨=Ã¥sum over all possible states C exp(ia A2)       (6) Here C is a constant. The symbol Ã¥ is to sum over all possible paths and states. The equation (6) is the universal wave function formulation of superstring theory. In our previous work, we have shown that this difference and the universal wave function formulation of string theory enable us to derive the existence of dark matter and dark energy as well as estimate vacuum energy possibly consistent with the current experimental data. According to superstring theory, also called M theory by people, all fundamental particles, interactions, and our observed space-time can be created from the combination of superstring action (5) and string action (6). Using the result obtained in string theory and M theory, it is not difficult to see that the universal wave function (6) also contains all the fundamental particles, interactions, and the observed space-time. In addition, the wave function tells a lot more about our universe than the current string theory. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that the wave function (6) tells us that our universe is a hologram. The observed space-time, particles, forces, and everything we observe is a projection from this hologram. From the universal wave function, we can show the existence of dark matter and dark energy in our universe. We can calculate the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological constant. We find that our estimate of vacuum energy from equation (6) is consistent with the experimental data. The universal wave function also tells us that our observed space-time is made of different cycles. The large space and time cycles makes up the macroscopic phenomena such as planets, stars, galaxies, and large scale-structure in our universe. The small space and time cycles make up microscopic phenomena, such as quarks, electrons, photons, atoms, molecules and more. It also indicates and provides the mathematic description about the multiverse structure of our universe.  7. Discussion ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\Space, Time, and the Creation of Universe.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content=\"SPACE, TIME, AND THE CREATION OF UNIVERSE \\n 73 In this work, we combine the ancient Chinese Tao wisdom about the creation with quantum physics. We propose and demonstrate mathematically that our universe is manifested from the emptiness through two basic human actions: measurement of space and time and measurement of inclusion and exclusion.  This work has great significance for the development of science. It provides a way to derive the grand unification theory, the one mathematic formula about our universe. It gives metaphysical understanding about string theory and makes it possible to bring out more testable results from string theory.  Philosophically, this work suggests and substantiates mathematically and scientifically that human action has manifested our universe from the emptiness. Our yin-yang action of space and time as well as inclusion and exclusion manifest our universe from Tao, the emptiness. Tao creates and includes all possibilities. Our action determines which possibility or possibilities are manifested from Tao.  This study expounds a deeper meaning and function of space and time. Space and time is a duality pair of the fundamental actions and codes that manifest our universe.  This work also provides insights to two important philosophical questions: Whether we can understand our world and why we can express the natural law mathematically. Mathematics is the human logic and derivation based on numbers and symbols. How can the universe follow human logic? The result of this study indicates that we can understand the universe because our own actions manifest the world we observe. Since mathematics is the universal language and logic of our actions and our mind, we can use mathematics to describe the universe and everything in our lives and the world. Tao is beyond our comprehension and description. But we can comprehend the universe and the world we experience because we create it. More than 2500 years ago, Buddha reached the enlightenment when he gained the deep insight about how everyone and everything is created. Buddha realized that the physical reality is created from the emptiness through peopleâs discrimination and attachment. Buddhaâs teaching has helped million people release their suffering and reach Nirvana. Our work demonstrates Buddhaâs profound wisdom and other similar spiritual wisdom about the creation mathematically and scientifically.  To understand scientifically and mathematically how we create the universe and the world we experience is one of the most empowering and enlightening knowledge. This understanding, wisdom, and knowledge can enlighten and liberate more people from the illusion and ignorance. It can relieve our suffering and bondage. It can uplift us to a higher level of existence. When we understand how we create our own reality, we will have the power to transcend our limitations and live a life with greater freedom and potential. We can manifest a better world with more love, peace, and harmony. We encourage more people to explore and contribute to the study of this subject and area.  Works Cited Adler, Joseph A.

In our previous paper [\\nZhi Gang Sha and \\nRulin Xiu\\n2018\\n], we demonstrate that\\n \\never\\nyone and everything \\nis made of matter, energy, and information. Here we define \\nmatter as everything we measure and observe. For example, \\nlength, width, height, distance, weight, mass, charge, electric \\nfield, spin, force, and many more are all different pro\\nperties \\nand phenomena of matter.\\n \\nEnergy is the ability to move and \\nchange matter, such as lifting a weight and heating up a pot of \\nwater. \\n \\n \\nInformation is that which\\n \\ninforms. It is what gives form to the \\nphenomenon we observe. For instance, the information\\n \\nin our\\n \\nbank account determines how much money we have in the \\nbank. The blueprint of a house determines what the house \\nlooks like. Information theory tells us that information \\ndescribes the possibilities and potentialities of something. \\nInformation has thr\\nee components: the content of the \\ninformation, the receiver of the information, and processor of \\nthe information.\\n \\nBased on this understanding about the \\nfundamental constituents of everything, we propose to define \\nspirit or soul as the content of informatio\\nn. Here we donât \\ndifferentiate between spirit and soul. We suggest defining the \\nspiritual heart as the receiver of information and the mind as \\nthe processor of information, respectively. According to \\nquantum physics, a\\n \\nvibrational field carries information\\n, \\nenergy, and matter. Some of the vibrations can be quantum \\nentangled, also called quantum correlated, with other \\nvibrations. When some of the vibrations are observed to be in a \\ncertain state, the state of the vibrations with which the \\nobserved vibrations \\nare quantum entangled are instantly turned \\ninto the state that is determined by the quantum entanglement. \\nBy turning our soul, the content of the information, into a \\nspecific state, we can affect the people and things we are \\nvibrationally entangled or quan\\ntum entangled with instantly \\nwithout direct physical contact. In the same way, the people \\nand things that are quantum entangled with us can influence us \\ninstantly without direct physical contact. We suggest that \\nquantum entanglement can explain scientifica\\nlly such spiritual \\nphenomena as distant viewing, telepathy, clairvoyance, \\npsychokinesis, distant healing and more. According to our \\ndefinition of soul, spiritual heart, and mind, everything has a \\nsoul, a spiritual heart, and a mind, including elementary \\npa\\nrticles, molecules, plants, stones, planets. Soul, spiritual \\nheart, and mind as defined above can be calculated and \\nmeasured in quantum physics [\\nZhi Gang Sha and Rulin Xiu\\n, \\n2018\\n]. The spiritual heart relates to our ability to receive \\ninformation. It descri\\nbes how much and what kind of \\ninformation we can receive, that\\n \\nin turn determines what kinds \\nof vibrations\\n \\nwe absorb. In the following discussion, we will \\nuse quantum physics to explain why and how spiritual heart \\nmanifests our\\n \\nphysical reality.\\n \\n \\nFunction \\nof the Spiritual Heart\\n: \\nAccording to the above \\ndefinitions of soul, heart, and mind, soul is the content of the \\ninformation contained in something. According to information \\ntheory, information describes possibilities and potentialities \\nwithin an object. \\n \\nI\\nn quantum physics, everything is a vibrational field, which is \\nmathematically described by the wave function. The \\nvibrational field usually contains various possible vibrations \\nand states. However, the observed phenomenon usually \\nconsists of certain specif\\nic outcomes. How does a single \\nconcrete outcome emerge from the many possibilities?\\n \\nTo \\nunderstand how this happens, we need first to know the role of \\na detector in observing quantum phenomena. In quantum \\nphysics, to observe a quantum phenomenon, one must u\\nse a \\ndetector or detectors to receive vibrations from what is being \\nobserved. A detector is an instrument specially designed to \\nabsorb vibrations,\\n \\nand show visible and measurable changes as \\na result. For instance, a camera is a detector. Photographic film \\nor digital detectors are used to detect visible images, X\\n-\\nrays, \\nand more. \\n \\n \\nAn observed quantum phenomenon\\n \\ndepends on what kinds of \\ndetectors we use and where and how we place the detectors. \\nDifferent detectors exhibit different phenomena because they \\nabso\\nrb different vibrations. For instance, if you use a normal \\ncamera, you will see images of visible light. If you use a \\nspecial camera that can receive infrared light, you will catch \\nimages of infrared light. Furthermore, where and how we place \\nour camera an\\nd the angle at which we direct our camera \\ngreatly affect the resulting photograph. For example, in \\nquantum physics experiments, where we place the detector \\ndetermines where we find the photons. The direction we put \\nthe polarizer determines the polarization\\n \\nof the detected light. \\nIn summary, the kinds of detectors we use and where and how \\nwe place the detectors determine the phenomena we observe. \\nNotice that detectors are a receiver of vibrations. The process \\nof quantum phenomenon being determined by the det\\nector \\nindicates how our spiritual heart determines our physical \\nreality. We suggest that quantum physics teaches us that our \\nspiritual heart determines\\n \\nthe reality we observe. \\n \\n \\nWe propose that quantum measurement suggests the \\nmanifestation process as the \\nfollowing\\n. First, our soul gives the \\ncontent of information. This information content determines \\nwhich part of our spiritual heart we are going to apply and \\nwhere and how we are going to place our spiritual heart. Our \\nspiritual heart specifies what kind of\\n \\ninformation and \\nvibrations we receive, and this in turn stipulates how our mind \\nprocesses the information. After our mind processes the \\ninformation it\\n \\nthen directs how much energy and where the \\nenergy goes. Energy moves matter. Matter is the physical \\nreal\\nity we observe. This manifestation process suggested by \\nquantum physics teaches us that although physical reality is all \\nwe observe, it is determined by our soul, heart, and mind. It \\nreveals the important role the spiritual heart plays in the \\nmanifestation\\n \\nprocess. This is consistent with what spiritual \\nwisdom teaches us. \\n \\nWe conclude that our scientific definition \\nof soul, heart, and mind makes it possible to use quantum \\nphysics to explain the significance of spiritual heart in the \\nmanifestation of our phy\\nsical reality. It also helps us to \\nunderstand the manifestation process in greater detail \\nscientifically. It shows us how the soul, spiritual heart, mind, \\nand energy establish our physical reality.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\n \\nIn this paper, we show that if we define spir\\nitual heart as the \\nreceiver of information, quantum physics may explain why and \\nhow spiritual heart plays a crucial role in determining our \\nphysical reality. This indicates the possibility\\n \\nof\\n \\nexplaining \\n71\\n7\\n43\\n              \\n                                  \\n \\nDr. Zhi Gang Sha and \\nRulin Xiu\\n, \\nSpiritual \\nheart and the manifestation of physical reality\\n \\n ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\SPIRITUAL HEART AND THE MANIFESTATION OF PHYSICAL REALITY.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='spiritual wisdom scientifically using quantum physics\\n.

Long-Range Vibrations, Large-Distance Anisotropies and\\nAnomalous Alignment\\nA natural indication and consequence of UWFIST is the existence of long-range\\nvibrations. The space âtime coordinate XÂ¹Ã°/C28;/C27Ãis composed of vibrations in the form\\nexpÂ½i/C25nÃ°/C27Ã¾c/C28Ã/L] and expÂ½i/C25nÃ°/C27/C0c/C28Ã/L]. Here, nis an integer. Unlike the normal\\nstring theory, in which Lis the Planck length, in UWFIST as we have explained\\nbefore, Lis the length of causal horizon. The largest wavelength is on the order of the\\nlength of the causal horizon. These vibrations are very Â¯ne in the sense that they vary\\nin space and time very slowly therefore it is very diÂ±cult to detect them. In fact, to\\ndetect the vibration with the wavelength L, it takes the time L/c or it requires the\\ndetector that is at least on the order of L.I fLis the horizon distance, this means thatString Theory Explanation of Large-Scale Anisotropy\\n1750012-5\\nRep.

In our previous work,37,38we showed that\\nthese long-range vibrations can be the source of dark energy and provide the way to\\nderive and explain why the cosmological constant is so small. They are also potentialcandidates for inÂ°aton and oÂ®er a new inÂ°aton scheme that can be derived and\\ncalculated from string theory.\\nHere, we are going to show that these large-scale quantum vibrations can\\ncause large-scale correlation. To demonstrate this, we calculate the correction\\nfunction:\\nh /C3Ã°x;tÃ Ã°xÃ¾/C1x;tÃ¾/C1tÃi\\nthat are created by the long-range vibrations expÂ½i/C25nÃ°xÃ¾ctÃ=L/C138as an example.\\nSince the experimental measurement is made over a range of time, let's say /C1T,\\nwe need to calculate\\nZ\\n/C1T\\n0h /C3Ã°x;tÃ Ã°xÃ¾/C1x;tÃ¾/C1tÃi /C24ei/C25/C1x=LÂ½ei/C25c/C1T=L/C01/C138:\\nAsLis on the scale of horizon, c/C1T/Lis close to zero.\\nZ/C1T\\n0h /C3Ã°x;tÃ Ã°xÃ¾/C1x;tÃ¾/C1tÃi /C24ei/C25/C1x=LsinÃ°/C25c/C1T=LÃ/C24Ã°/C25c/C1T=LÃei/C25/C1x=L:Ã°9Ã\\nThe result (9) indicates that the correlation caused by the long-range vibration\\nis non-zero. This correlation varies on the order of the length of the horizon L.I ti s\\nproportional to the measurement time /C1T. Such correlation does not exist for the\\nnormal string theory or particle physics where L is very small. However, in the wave\\nfunction interpretation of string theory, this large-distance correlation appears\\nnaturally in UWFIST. It is a direct and obvious derivation from UWFIST.\\nSome of the consequences of this large-distance correlation derived from UWFIST\\nare that it can cause large-scale anisotropies, non-Gaussian distribution, and large-\\nscale correlation in the CMB and other radiation or matter background.\\nIt has been found that the statistical anisotropy and Gaussianity of temperature\\nÂ°uctuations is mainly due to the long-range correlations.41,42There is also\\nfurther evidence of correlations between the WMAP data and two all-sky probes of\\nlarge-scale structure, the hard X-ray background observed by the HEAO-1 satellite\\nand the NVSS survey of radio galaxies.41,42This observation agrees with the\\nUWFIST.\\nBecause these long-range vibrations are quantum vibrations, their alignment is\\ndetermined by the measurement. It is similar to the observation of the polarization of\\nlight. The observed polarization is determined by the direction of the polarizer. In the\\nsame way, the alignment of the quadrupole and octupole modes is determined by themeasurement. Since all of our detectors are placed in the solar system and Earth in\\nthe ecliptic plane, the alignment of both quadrupole and octupole modes should be\\ndone with the ecliptic plane and equinox.Z.

They are due to the large-scale quantum\\nvibrations predicted in UWFIST. In fact, we suggest that the large-scale aniso-\\ntropies, non-Gaussian distribution, and anomalous alignment provide the criticalexperimental evidence for UWFIST. Furthermore, UWFIST suggests that since\\nthe large-scale quantum vibrations are the source for dark energy, the large-scale\\nanisotropies, non-Gaussian distribution, and anomalous alignment can also provide\\nsome detailed information about dark energy.\\n4. Discussion and Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we show that the universal wave function formulation of string theory\\n(UWFIST) can explain the large-scale anisotropies and the anomalous alignment of\\ncosmic background radiation. We show that the long-range quantum vibrations,\\npredicted in UWFIST, can cause the large-scale anisotropies and anomalous align-\\nment in the microwave background and other matter and radiation background. The\\nanomalous alignment with the solar system is due to that fact that the measurement\\nis made in the solar system. The anomalous alignment does not violate the Coper-\\nnican principle.\\nIn our previous work,\\n39we have shown that from UWFIST, we can estimate the\\nvacuum energy and cosmological constant consistent with the experimental result\\nusing the age of the universe and the fundamental constants },G, and c. We suggest\\nthat the large-scale anisotropies and the anomalous alignment of CMB radiation and\\nother matter and radiation provide further evidence and conÂ¯rmation for the validity\\nof UWFIST as a promising grand uniÂ¯ed theory.\\nThe calculation of the correlation function caused by the long-range vibration\\nin (9) indicates that the correlation function is proportional to the measurement time\\n/C1T. The experimental proof of this result can be used as a further validation of\\nUWFIST as the grand uniÂ¯cation theory. We will explore this in the future work.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Dr. Ervin Laszlo, and many others for their help, support and encour-\\nagement with this project.

From this insight, we define \\nspirit or soul as the content of information, spiritual heart as \\nthe receiver of information, \\nand mind as the processor of \\ninformation.(Wemake no distinction between spirit and soul \\nand treat them as the same.)We then show how these \\ndefinitions make it possible to explain and rigorously study \\nspiritual phenomena using quantum physics, \\nthereby provi\\nding\\n \\na way to integrate natural science with spirituality at a \\nfundamental level.\\n \\n \\nThe \\nindication of quantum physics about the constituents \\nof the existence\\n \\n \\nQuantum physics is the most fundamental physics theory to \\ndate. It has been shown that classical \\nphysics is an \\napproximation of quantum physics. Quantum physics yields \\nthe most accurate predictions about nature so far.\\n \\nQuantum \\nphysics studies what everything is made of and how it behaves \\nat the microscopic level. Studies in quantum physics indicate \\nth\\nat at the deepest level, everything is made of various \\nvibrations, also called waves. Vibrations or waves are\\n \\nperiodic \\noscillations extending over space and time. Quantum vibration \\nalso has the character of a particle in the sense that it has \\nspecific ener\\ngy and can only be absorbed or emitted as a \\nwhole.\\n \\nAccording to quantum physics, everything\\n \\nis basically a \\nvibrational field consisting of various vibrations. These \\nvibrational fields are described mathematically \\nby wave\\n \\nfunction. Wave function is the math\\nematical formula that \\nexpresses the properties and quantity of vibrations or waves of \\nan object. Quantum physics provides ways to calculate wave \\nfunction. From wave function, one can derive the characters \\nand qualities of an object and make predictions.\\n \\nWe\\n \\npropose \\nthat quantum physics suggests that everyone and everything is \\nmade of information, energy, and matter. \\nHere we define \\nmatter as anything we measure, observe, and experience. For \\nexample, length, width, height, distance, weight, mass, charge, \\nelect\\nric field, spin, force, and many more are all different \\nproperties and aspects of matter.\\n \\n \\nEnergy is the ability to do work, such as lifting a weight and \\nheating up a pot of water. Energy moves matter or changes its \\nstate. For example, heat, kinetic energy\\n, and potential energy \\ncan help do work which results in moving the matter and \\nchanging its state.\\n \\nInformation is what informs. To inform is to \\ngive an answer to a question. The answer to a question can be \\nrepresented as yes and/or no.  Therefore, informat\\nion can be \\nrepresented as a series of yesâs and/or noâs.\\n \\nThe founding of \\ninformation theory makes it possible to \\ndefine information as a \\nmeasurable mathematical quantity. Claude Shannon, the \\nfounder of Information Theory, realized that to measure \\ninformati\\non is to count the number of possibilities in an object \\n(\\nShannon\\n, 1948).\\n \\nIn the general case, Shannon found that the \\nmeasure of information relates to the entropy discovered in the \\nfield of thermodynamics.\\n \\nWe propose that quantum physics \\nsupports the assum\\nption that everything is made of \\ninformation, energy and matter. Quantum physics tells us that \\neverything is made of a vibrational field, which can be \\nmathematically described by a wave function. A wave function \\ndescribes the possible states, i.e. possibil\\nities, of an object. \\nTherefore, wave function accounts for the informational \\naspects of the object. The matter aspect of each \\nvibration/particle or state is described by its frequency and \\nwavelength and other quantities such as charge, mass, and \\nmore,\\n \\nthat\\n \\ncan be measured. Each vibration or state also carries \\nenergy. Quantum physics tells us that the energy E of a \\nvibration is related to its frequency Î½ through the formula:\\n \\nE = hÎ½.\\n \\n \\nHere h is Planck constant, a physical constant discovered in \\nquantum physic\\ns.  Planck constant describes the value of basic \\nquantum action.\\nIt is found to be of value \\n6.62607004 Ã 10\\n-\\n34\\n \\nm\\n2\\n \\nkg / s.\\n \\nNot only quantum physics indicates everything is \\nmade of information, energy, and matter, but classical physics \\nalso suggests this. \\nThermodynamics studies how pressure and \\ntemperature affect the movement of matter and energy. It uses \\nan equation of state to describe a system. Thermodynamics \\ndiscovers an important quantity to describe a system, which is \\nentropy. Thermodynamics and infor\\nmation theory reveal \\nthatentropy measures the information in a system. The basic \\nequation of state in thermodynamics is:\\n \\n \\ndE = T dS \\nâ\\n \\nP dV.\\n \\n \\nHere E represents energy and dE is the change of energy. S is \\nentropy and dS is the change of entropy. T is tempera\\nture. P is \\npressure. V is volume, and dV is the change of volume. This \\nequation basically describes the relation among matter, energy, \\nand information. Therefore, thermodynamics supports our \\nproposal that everything is made of information, energy, and \\nmatt\\ner.\\n \\nSince classical physics is an approximation of quantum \\nphysics, we  conclude \\nthat physics\\n \\ncorroborates our \\nassumption that everything is made of information, energy, and \\nmatter.\\n \\n \\nDefinition of Soul, Heart, and Mind\\n \\n \\nInformation has three related components: the content \\nof \\ninformation\\n, the receiver of information, and processor of \\ninformation. \\nWe \\nsuggest that\\n \\nsoul (or spirit), spiritual heart, \\nand mind represent these three aspectsof information. To \\nclarify, they arede\\nfined in the following way:\\n \\n \\nSoul is the content of\\n \\ninformation carried in everything.\\n \\n \\nSpiritual heart is the receiver of\\n \\ninformation in everything.\\n \\n \\nMind is the processor of the information in everything.\\n \\n \\nAccording to the above definition, everyone and \\neverything \\nhas soul, heart, and mind, in addition to energy and matter. \\nQuarks, electrons, atoms, molecules, cells, animals, plants, \\nmountains, water, minerals, planets, stars, galaxies, and \\nuniverses all have soul, heart, and mind. This is because \\neveryon\\ne and everything carries, receives, and processes \\ninformation.\\n \\nWith the above definition, soul, spiritual heart, \\nand mind become measurable and calculable quantities. For \\ninstance, from the wave function, we can derive what kind of \\nquantum information is \\ninside something. In this way, we can \\ncalculate the quality and quantity of its soul. To calculate heart, \\nwe need to find out what kind of vibrations it can receive. \\nAccording to quantum physics, everyone and everything \\nreceives vibrations through resonanc\\ne. From its wave function, \\nwe can derive what kinds of vibrations the system can resonate \\nwith. In this way, we can know what kind of heart it has. \\nSpiritual heart can be measured by a spectroscope. \\nSpectrometry measures what kind of vibrations a system ca\\nn \\nreceive and/or emit. To know about the mind property of an \\nobject, we can calculate or measure how it behaves or responds \\nafter receiving a vibration. If we know its wave function, this \\ncan also be calculated.\\n \\n \\n \\n50\\n73\\n          \\n      \\nZhi Gang Sha and Rulin Xiu\\n,\\n \\nThe composition of existence and the\\n \\ndefinition of spirit, heart and mind according to quantum physics\\n \\n ', metadata={'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\THE COMPOSITION OF EXISTENCE AND THE DEFINITION OF SPIRIT, HEART AND MIND ACCORDING TO QUANTUM PHYSICS.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Quantum Entanglement and Miraculous Spiritu\\nal Power\\n \\n \\nMore accurately, quantum physics tells us that everything \\nconsists of quantum information, energy, and matter. Quantum \\ninformation is the information carried by the object described \\nby wave function \\n(\\nNielsen\\n \\net al., \\n2010).\\n \\nClassical information \\ni\\ns carried by the object described by the equation of motion in \\nclassical physics. Quantum information has the amazing ability \\nto teleport itself through quantum entanglement. To teleport is \\nto transport quantum information instantly to another location \\nwit\\nhout physically moving matter and energy.\\n \\nQuantum \\nentanglement\\n \\nis a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs \\nor groups of particles/waves\\n \\nare generated or interact in ways \\nsuch that the quantum state\\n \\nof each particle cannot be \\ndescribed independently of \\nthe others, even when the \\nparticles/waves are separated by a large distance. \\n \\n \\nThe quantum state must be described for the system as a \\nwhole. For the quantum entangled vibrations/particles or \\nstates, when one experiences a certain state, the other\\n \\n(s) will\\n \\nautomatically and instantly experiencea certain corresponding \\nstate regardless of the distance.\\n \\nQuantum entanglement \\nphenomenon indicates that if one has quantum vibrations that \\nare quantum entangled with other vibrations, when oneâs state \\nchanges, it aff\\nects\\n \\nthose\\n \\nothers instantly, independent of any\\n \\nseparation or distance. In the same way, one can also be \\naffected by the ones with whom oneâs vibrations are quantum \\nentangled. The existence of quantum Entanglement \\nphenomenon tells us that:\\n \\n \\n1.\\n \\nBy changing the\\n \\ninformation within us, we may be able \\nto affect others. This explains spiritual healing, soul \\nhealing, and \\npsycho kinesis\\n.\\n \\n2.\\n \\nOur thoughts may affect others. Our \\nthoughts are\\n \\nvibrations carrying information. By changing our \\nthoughts, we change the informatio\\nn. This may lead to \\nchanges in the information of those with whom we are \\nquantum entangled.\\n \\n3.\\n \\nOne may realize the ability \\nto access\\n \\ninformation of \\nothers with whom one shares quantum entanglements, \\ndemonstrating abilities such as clairvoyance and \\ntelepathy.\\n \\nIn other words, information about others \\nmay \\nbe\\n \\navailable to you if you are quantum entangled with \\nthem, even though you are not in direct contact with \\nthem.\\n \\n4.\\n \\nOur \\nsoul can\\n \\nteleport: Teleportation is the transfer of \\ninformation, energy, and matter to another location \\ninstantly without physical movement.\\n \\n \\nThe more quantum entanglement one has with others, the \\ngreater is oneâ\\n \\nspotential to demonstrate the abilities mentioned \\na\\nbove. We thus suggest that the parapsychological or spiritual \\nabilities can be explained by quantum physics. Quantum \\nphysics provides a\\n \\ntheoretical and mathematic framework as \\nwell as experimental methods to demonstrate proof about the \\npossibilities of the\\nse abilities.\\n \\nAncient Chinese Tao wisdom \\ntells us that everyone and everything is made of Jing, Qi, and \\nShen. In the frame of this work, Jing is matter. Qi is energy. \\nShen is information and includes soul, heart and mind. In \\nChinese, the character âShenâ m\\neans miraculous quality. This \\nwork can explain\\n \\nShenâsmiraculous abilities.\\n \\nEvery culture and \\ntradition has documented cases of people possessing the \\nspiritual abilities mentioned here. \\nOur physics\\n \\ndefinition and \\ninsight about soul, heart, and mind provides\\n \\na way to explain \\nthese spiritual phenomena using quantum physics. It tells us \\nthat everyone and everything intrinsically has these miraculous \\nspiritual abilities. It shows us that to enhance our spiritual \\npower, one should enhance oneâs quantum entangleme\\nnt with \\nothers.\\n \\nNow it becomes meaningful to study scientifically how \\nto enhance quantum entanglement and therefore, these \\nabilities. We believe paying attention to, developing, and \\nutilizing these abilities through the power of Shen (soul, heart \\nand mind)\\n \\ncan help take humanity to the next level of \\nexistence.\\n \\n \\nConclusion\\n \\n \\nIn this paper, we show that everyone and everything is made of \\ninformation, energy, and matter. We propose to define soul as \\nthe content of quantum information, heart as the receiver of \\nq\\nuantum information and mind as the processor of quantum \\ninformation. We show that with this definition, quantum \\nphysics can explain spiritual phenomena and abilities. This \\ndemonstrates that parapsychological phenomena are \\ncompatible with the well\\n-\\nestablish\\ned laws of natural science. It \\nprovides a way to integrate the natural science with spiritual \\nand conscious studies.\\n \\nThis work has application in the natural \\nsciences, such as physics, medicine, biology, environmental \\nscience, and geology as well as social\\n \\nsciences such as \\neducation, psychology, philosophy,\\n \\nand more. It also has \\napplication in the emerging science of healing. This work also \\nprovides a new metaphysical explanation of quantum physics. \\nWe will explore these applications in our future work.\\n \\n \\nREFERENCES\\n \\n \\nBohr, N.\\n \\n1928.
