# Topic2Dataset

## üëãüèºIntroduction
data collection and preprocessing can be time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks. Topic2Dataset ia an open source project that helps by automating dataset generation from specified topics and websites, eliminating manual data gathering and accelerating dataset creation timelines. This project mainly aims to curate datasets for Retrieval augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM finetuning.

## üîëKey Features
- **Effortless Dataset Generation:** Generate datasets for pre-training, fine-tuning, and preference modeling with ease.
- **Tailored Instruction and Data:** Upload a document and receive customized instructions and data for fine-tuning models.
- **AI-Powered Scraping:** Live AI agent-based scrapers ensure relevance, accuracy, and up-to-date data extraction.
- **Time-Dependent Scraping:** Keep datasets fresh and relevant with time-dependent scraping capabilities.
- **Seamless Data Export:** Export datasets to S3 and other blob storage services effortlessly for further analysis and usage.
- **Insightful Summarization:** Receive answers to questions and insights relevant to the document's content for enhanced understanding.
